For dispositions, cash cap rate is a rate of return based on the annualized cash rental income of the property to be sold. For acquisitions, cash cap rate is calculated by dividing this annualized cash rental income the property will generate (before debt service and depreciation and after fixed costs and variable costs) by the purchase price of the property, excluding acquisition costs. For dispositions, cash cap rate is calculated by dividing the annualized cash rental income by the contract sales price for the property, excluding acquisition costs Weighted average cash cap rates are based on square feet unless otherwise indicated.4 Occupancy represents percentage of square footage of which the tenant has taken possession of divided by the respective total rentable square feet as of the date or period end indicated. Executed Occupancy Includes Occupancy as of a particular date as well as all leases fully executed by both parties as of the same date where the tenant has yet to take possession as of such date. For Q3'21 and as of November 1, 2021, there are 15 additional leases executed where rent commences over time between the fourth quarter of 2021 and the first quarter of 2022 totaling approximately 122 000 square feet. 5 For AFIN, Leasing Pipeline for Q3'21 includes i) all leases fully executed by both parties as of November 1, 2021, but after September 30, 2021 and (ii) all leases under negotiation with an executed LOI by both parties as of November 1, 2021.

For the Transaction and Q3'21, includes a 13,000 SF Leasing Pipeline acquired in the Transaction. There can be no assurance that LOIs will lead to definitive leases that will commence on their current terms, or at all.

Implied investment grade may include actual ratings of tenant parent, guarantor parent (regardless of whether or not the parent has guaranteed the tenant's obligation under the lease) or by using a proprietary Moody's analytical tool, which generates an implied rating by measuring a company's probability of default.

This includes building additional technology and AI / machine learning (ML) enhancements, further developing the platform capabilities to enhance the user experience, expanding into additional settings of care, and continuing to invest in growing the company's team to support revolutionizing how healthcare is delivered so providers can return to focusing on patients instead of keyboards.""We are excited to continue expanding the RemitOneTM platform into new practices, new specialties, and new settings of care. Accurate and compliant medial documentation and efficient claims processing at the point of care doesn't have to fall on our front-line providers and it doesn't have to be kicked to the back office. It can be addressed front and center, in a compliant fashion, with our platform. We are looking forward to MCC's bright future where every day our change agents are fueled by witnessing the sudden relief experienced by providers who are introduced to our platform with every implementation,"" said John Bright, Founder & CEO of MCC.The MCC team of dedicated change agents works tirelessly to build our one-of-a-kind platform, RemitOne™, and deliver its supporting services. We are committed to reducing provider burden while eradicating improper payments in healthcare. RemitOne™ works at the point of care as a front-end clean claims processing technology through voice-enabled AI and ML technologies that not only capture the patient encounter but generate a structured medical record of the encounter and translate it into an electronic claim form that is submitted to the payor. RemitOne™ has been shown to reduce provider workflow burdens resulting in increased access to quality care and improved patient engagement. Results have also shown an unprecedented ability to ensure accurate and compliant coding and billing services that gets it right the first time. This reduces the need for payors to perform pre-payment reviews and post-payment reviews making intrusive audits and payment claw backs a thing of the past. When documentation and coding are accurate, complete, and reliable, the rest of the healthcare process can work far more efficiently and cost-effectively.Due to the ever-increasing administrative burden, providers are burnt out. What's more, administrative costs are adding to the rising cost of healthcare in the US. Studies have found that, on average, it costs healthcare provider organizations an average of $20.52 in administrative overhead to submit a primary care claim to an insurance company. Additionally, it costs the insurance company on average over $40 in administrative overhead to receive the claim and process it to payment. Between a patient's doctor's office and their insurance company, over $60 is spent in administrative work to generate and process a claim that on average pays approximately $80. From the payor's perspective, every year, the Medicare Fee- for-Service program improperly pays $25B+ due to insufficient and/or incomplete documentation. This triggers post-payment review programs such as the Medicare Administrative Contractor's (MACs) Target, Probe, and Educate (TPE) program, or worse, when plans begin down coding claims to insulate from insufficient documentation. Providers can be insulated from these programs and payors can prevent improper payments from going out with the implementation of the RemitOneTM platform at the point of care.To learn more about MCC visit mccremitone.com or view MCC's documentary segment that aired on CNBC here: https://www.mccremitone.net/r1video/MCC_03.mp4.About MCCMCC provides Revenue Cycle Management Services, Health Information Management, and Computer Assisted Clinical Documentation Improvement Services that pair with innovative technology which leverages Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) to code claims and to analyze and interpret clinical documentation from the point of care.

As people continue to choose convenient, sustainable forms of transportation like Veo's e-scooters, bikes, and e-bikes, micromobility is becoming a fundamental part of the 21st century transportation system.In 2021, Veo further expanded in the Northeast and West Coast regions, including two of the most competitive cities for micromobility: New York and Santa Monica. Veo was the only company granted a permit in both cities, proving itself to be a leader in a crowded industry. The company also was awarded new permits, secured contract renewals, or increased its fleet size in Colorado Springs, Colo., Long Beach, Calif., Newark, NJ, Toledo, Ohio, Syracuse, NY, Seattle, Wash., and at The University of Alabama.Veo plans to amplify this growth with new vehicle types, use cases and enter new markets in 2022. The announcement comes on the heels of the company's $16 million in a Series A capital fundraising round.""Our financial success, particularly achieving company-wide EBIT profitability year-over-year, is based on intentional and responsible growth in long-term partnerships with cities and universities,"" said Candice Xie, Veo co-founder. ""The biggest key to growth is to work closely with our local partners to create environments where riders can find, ride, and park scooters safely, and to match cities' efforts to diversify ridership by bringing new vehicle types to the market that meet more riders' needs.""Adding new vehicle types to Veo's fleet helps meet cities' goals of diversifying ridership and increasing access to sustainable, safe mobility options. In 2021, Veo unveiled the Astro 4 stand-up e-scooter, the Cosmo seated e-scooter, and the Cosmo e-bike, which utilize the industry's first waterproof swappable batteries. This allowed Veo to swap out low batteries instead of transporting scooters to warehouses to charge overnight, improving efficiency and reducing the environmental impact of using fossil fuel operated trucks and vans to collect the vehicles for charging. Veo also was the first company to include turn signals and bright underdeck lighting features to enhance rider safety.In 2022, Veo will introduce two new vehicle types to its fleet, a completely redesigned Class 2 e-bike and a three-wheel e-scooter and will make significant enhancements to the existing six devices in its product line. The new vehicles are designed to make travel easier and more comfortable for riders of diverse ages and abilities. New features will allow e-bikes and e-scooters to make longer trips and enable riders to carry more items, like groceries.""Producing the most advanced, durable, and comfortable scooters and bikes on the street is what keeps riders choosing Veo,"" said Edwin Tan, Veo co-founder. ""We handle all design and manufacturing in-house, and control the entire supply chain process, from design to fabrication and final assembly. Establishing our own supply chain and manufacturing capabilities allows us to be more cost effective and ensure the best quality product.""Veo rose to the top of the micromobility market over the last year due to its fundamentally different approach to financial responsibility and high-quality vehicles. The company took its time to build a profitable business model before scaling with VC money, setting it apart from the industry norm. Veo also sustains limited or exclusive partnerships and collaborates closely with cities to ensure every program is financially viable for the long haul.Moving forward, in addition to providing personal transportation options, Veo believes micromobility will play a critical role in logistics, specifically last-mile deliveries in cities. Deliveries are already increasing congestion and creating double parking challenges as e-commerce companies work to deliver products to consumers as quickly as possible. Communities can reduce congestion and free-up curb space by locating fulfillment centers closer to customers and requiring items to be delivered with smaller vehicles like e-bikes and e-scooters.About VeoVeo is bringing the next generation of shared electric bikes and scooters to cities and universities around the world. Founded in 2017 by two Purdue University graduates, Veo operates from a set of values that distinguish us in the industry. We are grounded in financial responsibility: Veo partnered with select cities to achieve profitability before scaling. Our in-house design and manufacturing process enables us to constantly innovate and provide cities with vehicle fleets that are made to last. We develop collaborative, long-term partnerships with cities and universities so we can work together toward a sustainable, safe, and equitable transportation future. Learn more at www.veoride.com.

The words ""will"", ""expects"", ""plans"", ""prospective"", ""forecasts"", ""outlook"" and similar expressions are often intended to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words. Specific forward-looking statements in this news release include, but are not limited to, statements regarding: the expected performance and growth of AQN, including expectations regarding Adjusted Net Earnings per share; capital expenditure plans; investment opportunities; development projects (including Blue Violet and Riverbend, as well as projects co-owned with Chevron); greenfield opportunities and pipelines; and the expected beneficial impacts on AQN of the energy transition. These statements are based on factors or assumptions that were applied in drawing a conclusion or making a forecast or projection, including assumptions based on historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments. Since forward-looking statements relate to future events and conditions, by their very nature they require making assumptions and involve inherent risks and uncertainties. AQN cautions that although it is believed that the assumptions are reasonable in the circumstances, these risks and uncertainties give rise to the possibility that actual results may differ materially from the expectations set out in the forward-looking statements. Material risk factors and assumptions include those set out in AQN's Management Discussion & Analysis and Annual Information Form for the year ended December 31, 2020, and in AQN's Management Discussion & Analysis for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2021 (the ""Interim MD&A""), each of which is available on SEDAR and EDGAR. In addition, the Company's expected Adjusted Net Earnings per share range of $0.72 to $0.77 for the 2022 fiscal year is based on the following additional assumptions:normalized weather patterns in the geographical areas in which the Company operates or has projects; rate decisions in line with expectations; renewable energy production and realized pricing consistent with long-term averages; no impacts from COVID-19 on operations; closing of the acquisition of New York American Water Company, Inc. at the beginning of 2022; and closing of the acquisition of Kentucky Power Company and AEP Kentucky Transmission Company, Inc. in mid-2022.Given these risks, undue reliance should not be placed on these forward-looking statements, which apply only as of their dates. Other than as specifically required by law, AQN undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect new information, subsequent or otherwise.Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresThe term ""Adjusted Net Earnings"" is not a recognized measure under U.S. GAAP. There is no standardized measure of ""Adjusted Net Earnings"" and, consequently, AQN's method of calculating this measure may differ from methods used by other companies and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. A calculation and analysis of ""Adjusted Net Earnings"", including a reconciliation to net earnings, is set out below and can also be found in the Interim MD&A and the Annual MD&A. ""Adjusted Net Earnings"" is a non-GAAP measure used by many investors to compare net earnings from operations without the effects of certain volatile primarily non-cash items that generally have no current economic impact or items such as acquisition expenses or litigation expenses that are viewed as not directly related to a company's operating performance. AQN uses ""Adjusted Net Earnings"" to assess its performance without the effects of (as applicable): gains or losses on foreign exchange, foreign exchange forward contracts, interest rate swaps, acquisition costs, one-time costs of arranging tax equity financing, litigation expenses and write down of intangibles and property, plant and equipment, earnings or loss from discontinued operations, unrealized mark-to-market revaluation impacts (other than those realized in connection with the sales of development assets), costs related to management succession and executive retirement, costs related to prior period adjustments due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, costs related to condemnation proceedings, financial impacts on the Company's Senate Wind Facility from the significantly elevated pricing that persisted in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas market over several days as a result of the February 2021 extreme winter storm conditions experienced in Texas and parts of the central U.S., changes in value of investments carried at fair value, and other typically non-recurring items as these are not reflective of the performance of the underlying business of AQN. The non-cash accounting charge related to the revaluation of U.S. deferred income tax assets and liabilities as a result of implementation of the effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is adjusted as it is also considered a non-recurring item not reflective of the performance of the underlying business of AQN. AQN believes that analysis and presentation of net earnings or loss on this basis will enhance an investor's understanding of the operating performance of its businesses. ""Adjusted Net Earnings"" is not intended to be representative of net earnings or loss determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and can be impacted positively or negatively by these items.SOURCE Algonquin Power & Utilities Corp.

Rejuveron has funded a further $20m in the $29 million series A financing round to enable Endogena to progress treatments targeting degenerative diseases of the eye.More news about: Rejuveron Life Sciences AG","Rejuveron Life Sciences AG","ZÜRICH, Switzerland, Dec. 13, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Rejuveron Life Sciences AG, a Zürich-based biotechnology company developing technologies for healthy aging, today announced that it has strengthened its support to a near-majority holding in Endogena Therapeutics Inc., an endogenous regenerative therapeutics company. Rejuveron has funded a further $20m in the $29 million series A financing round to enable Endogena to progress treatments targeting degenerative diseases of the eye. In January, Rejuveron already provided $4.75 million as part of Endogena's $8m series A-1 financing round and is the largest shareholder in Endogena, alongside major investor DEFTA Partners. The new funding will enable Endogena to progress its lead program, EA-2353, a photoreceptor regeneration treatment for retinitis pigmentosa (RP) through first-in-human trials in the USA and to advance EA-2351, a treatment for geographic atrophy (GA) to IND.Subject to U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of its IND application, Endogena's lead program, EA-2353, will enter first-in-human trials in the first half of 2022. In May, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted orphan drug designation for EA-2353 which provides benefits including market exclusivity once approved, exemption of FDA application fees, and tax credits for qualified clinical trials.EA-2353 is an endogenous photoreceptor regeneration treatment for RP that works by selective regulation of the endogenous adult stem- and progenitor cells for controlled tissue repair. RP is a group of inherited diseases causing slow and progressive retinal degeneration and loss of vision, for which there is currently no cure for the majority of patients. It is the leading cause of inherited blindness, with an estimated 1.5 million people worldwide presently affected. Endogena's novel, small-molecule approach is gene-independent, which has significant advantages in this condition that has multiple genetic causes. It leverages an artificial intelligence-driven drug discovery platform and has the potential to become a paradigm shift in treating degenerative conditions related to aging and genetic disorders. EA-2351 is a novel pre-clinical candidate for the treatment of GA, an advanced form of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). GA is the leading cause of irreversible vision loss in the developed world and it has been estimated that almost 9% of the population older than 45 years of age is affected. Dry-AMD is characterized by extensive retinal pigment epithelium degeneration. There is a high unmet medical need in AMD patients as there are no approved treatments for the condition.Christian Angermayer, Chairman of Rejuveron Life Sciences AG, said: ""Endogena Therapeutics' approach for endogenous regenerative medicine is a novel treatment paradigm for common degenerative diseases that are becoming more prevalent due to demographic changes with aging populations.

The capital will be invested in automation and artificial intelligence (AI) to provide a totally unprecedented user experience (UX) for borrowers.The round of financing was led by the Cavalry Fund and included participation from strategic co-investors Atalaya Capital Management, Ellington Financial Inc., and Australia-based Pipeline Capital. The latest transaction brings the total capital raised by Beeline to $22 million. ""We're thrilled to welcome our new equity partners, who are aligned with our vision of using automation to disrupt the housing industry and revolutionize how people get mortgages,"" said Beeline President and Co-Founder Peter Gonzalez. ""This transaction positions Beeline to provide consumers with a home financing experience that surpasses all other currently available options.""The new funding will accelerate development of Beeline's groundbreaking mortgage automation platform, which identifies, processes, and resolves underwriting conditions in real-time so borrowers can instantly know if they are pre-approved for a loan. Beeline launched in June 2020 and has already closed nearly $500 million in mortgages. The company is currently licensed in 26 states and plans to add more. In just 15 minutes, Beeline gives borrowers ""Purchase-Ready Approvals,"" day or night, by using a borrower's exact financial information and predictive analytics rather than relying solely on information that borrowers declare, as traditional pre-approvals do. With the borrower's consent, Beeline securely accesses their bank, income, and tax information online, verifies the numbers instantly, and provides a reliable, accurate approval upfront, so borrowers are far less likely to encounter roadblocks or be disappointed later. Beeline borrowers can then choose a customizable loan option and lock their mortgage rate all in one session, from the comfort of their sofa, without having to talk to their Beeline Loan Guide, who is always on-hand if needed. Currently, over 95% of Beeline's customers who receive automated mortgage decisions are ultimately approved during the underwriting process. This high level of automation and accuracy reduces Beeline's origination costs, which enables the company to offer more attractive pricing compared to other lenders. ""This is the classic example of David up against the Goliaths of the mortgage industry,"" said Greg Ellis, chief brand officer and co-founder of Beeline. ""Our unique, mobile-first platform combines automation, AI, and a simple UX in new ways to free people from the usual back-and-forth loan process B.S., so they can celebrate the thrill of buying a home or the benefits of a refinance as quickly as possible."" ""Beeline's tech platform delights customers by streamlining the process to arrive quickly at their end goal, whether it's buying their dream home, doing a refinance, or buying an investment property,"" said Gonzalez. ""It is also built to lower the cost of creating a mortgage, so we need fewer employees per loan than traditional lenders — and our borrowers benefit from that in lower rates and costs.""For more information, please visit www.makeabeeline.com.

The pandemic, as well as the rise of DTC (direct to consumer) 10-15 minute grocery and convenience delivery services, have created a stronger need for brands and retailers to connect as consumers demand faster access to a wider variety of products and retailers shift towards continuous optimization and faster category resets. Pod Foods streamlines the procurement process for retailers while enabling data-driven discovery for the emerging brands that consumers want. Current investors from the Company's seed round, which previously saw the company raise $3 million, include Moment Ventures and M12.""As consumers increasingly drive demand, the retail landscape is changing. The old way for retailers and brands to connect no longer works,"" said Christian Gammill, partner at Industrious Ventures. ""Pod Foods is the first to provide the logistics infrastructure needed to completely overhaul the grocery supply chain for the better, creating a true end-to-end system that enables both retailers and brands to thrive.""The rapid growth of delivery services during the pandemic has contributed to a seismic shift in consumer expectations - and retailers are struggling to keep up. To adapt to increased demand for a constant stream of new and trending products delivered to their doorstep in under an hour, retailers need to embrace data and adopt new technology to find and procure emerging brands faster, regardless of format. Pod Foods helps retailers with this brand procurement, solving the problem of fragmentation for the segment of high-growth brands that cannot afford the challenges and expenses of incumbent wholesalers. At the same time, Pod Foods gives emerging brands a transparent and easy-to-use platform to quickly reach relevant retailers across the country - providing access to the infrastructure needed to scale affordably and eliminating hundreds of thousands of dollars in hidden fees, chargebacks, and other trade deductions. The unique marketplace connects the two sides with a streamlined UI, handling everything from orders down to fully-consolidated logistics that get the products from warehouse to shelf.""Before we created Pod Foods, we ran a cookie company that grew a huge fan base, and we experienced first-hand how damaged the supply chain was on both the retailer and brand side when trying to enter retail. Traditional distributors are incentivized, by nature of their business model, to focus on the highest-volume, established brands. They squeeze out the emerging, high-growth brands driving industry growth. This leads to a gap in supply at the retail level, as retailers struggle to discover and procure brands outside of established distribution networks,"" said Larissa Russell, Co-founder, and CEO of Pod Foods. ""The problem has become even more pronounced with pandemic-related production shortages as well as new consumer expectations in retail. Retailers have to respond even faster to get relevant products to their customers. More continuous, data-driven category optimization will take the place of quarterly or bi-annual product reviews and resets. Pod Foods is the only asset-lite digital B2B marketplace with full logistics built-in, offering a one-stop distribution service that allows retailers to discover, order, and receive products in a consolidated fashion, onboarding new brands and getting them to the shelf in as little as 24 hours. The company leverages proprietary logistics optimization software and a network of warehousing and carrier providers to empower the marketplace. It services not only traditional retail formats with wholesale products but also high-growth, direct-to-consumer delivery services like Gopuff, which was recently valued at $15B. ""Pod Foods has excelled at supporting emerging brands on a national scale,"" said Michael Berl, Head of Regional Partnerships at Gopuff. ""As Gopuff continues to enhance the retail experience, flexibility, speed, and efficiency are of the utmost value. Pod Foods has been an ideal partner with the ability to onboard products quickly and seamlessly, allowing us to continue to bring in the best assortment to our growing customer base."" The company's Series A will be used to expand the Pod Foods brand and retailer network, helping brands and retailers connect nationwide. Pod Foods will also be scaling their data team to facilitate better matching and liquidity, as well as to right-size inventory counts. The company recently hired Timothy Wee as CTO, who formerly led machine learning projects at Google, Amazon, and Walmart Labs. ""Retailers reacted correctly to the pandemic and prioritized keeping products flowing in the midst of price hikes and shortages. However, we're now seeing consumers shift spending habits back to locally sourced emerging products - and it is imperative for retailers to adapt quickly,"" said Fiona Lee, Co-founder, of Pod Foods. ""Since last year, we have more than doubled the number of brands on our platform. We're seeing a 20% increase in repeat brand purchases today compared to pre-pandemic data. Our solution helps them understand what to buy because we're seeing the trends ahead of anyone else. We match the most relevant brands to the right retailers and provide retailers with fast procurement of those items to help them keep shelves full, without the hassle of dealing directly with each brand. ""Other funds in the round include Unshackled Ventures, Barrel Ventures, Relish Works, X Factor Ventures, XRC Labs, K2 Global, Graphene Ventures and others.

The ION manufacturing platform has been deployed across more than two-dozen companies including Joby Aviation, Astra, Reliable Robotics, and some of the world's largest manufacturers. This latest funding will be used to scale ION to help customers increase production rates and product lines to meet global demand for manufactured products. With this round, Craft Ventures' Partner, Michael Tam will also join the First Resonance Board. ""ION plays a key role in our manufacturing operation as our primary shop floor execution system,"" said Joe Brennan, Manufacturing Lead at Joby Aviation. ""The in-built flexibility of their product enables us to execute both prototype and fully conforming manufacturing operations at the same time, while the rapid rollout of new and requested features supports rapid and sustainable growth. We look forward to working with First Resonance as we take the next steps on our journey to delivering sustainable air travel.""Since its launch in January 2020, First Resonance has seen 5x YoY growth as an increasing number of manufacturers adopt ION and existing customers expand their use of the platform to additional employees and departments including management and supply chain. The company plans to triple its head count in 2022 across product engineering, sales, marketing, and operations to meet rising demand.""Craft Ventures and First Resonance share a common vision of the power of software to transform traditionally underserved markets like manufacturing,"" said Michael Tam, Partner, Craft Ventures. ""With a deep understanding of the painful problems facing modern manufacturers and a product that addresses them, we believe First Resonance will lead this growing software sector.""First Resonance has a front row seat to the manufacturing, supply chain, and logistics challenges modern manufacturers are facing. As the world transitions to electric transportation and opens up airspace for new types of flying transportation, the challenges of supply chain backups, geopolitical tensions, and an increasing need to meet environmental and sustainability standards, managing an efficient manufacturing supply chain is incredibly difficult. After experiencing bottlenecks building modern hardware products using standard manufacturing processes at SpaceX, JPL, and Toyota, the First Resonance team developed the ION manufacturing platform to help engineers move quickly, collaborate with their teams efficiently, and make decisions automatically. ION is equipping companies that are taking on some of the hardest challenges with an easy-to-use platform to help them build in a more flexible and dynamic way – the path an increasing number of companies are taking to overcome these challenges. The platform is addressing the needs of the manufacturing execution system market which is anticipated to grow to $14.9B by 2025. This figure is being rapidly accelerated given the massive shift in supply chains brought on by a constantly shifting geopolitical landscape and accelerated by COVID-19.""With today's dynamic manufacturing environment, speed to understanding is everything,"" said Karan Talati, CEO, First Resonance. ""People and devices are more connected than ever before and taking advantage of that connectivity requires a completely different way of structuring manufacturing – an industry that has been stagnant for too long. We're excited to bring Craft Ventures and our existing investors on the journey to help our customers solve this decade's biggest challenges.""First Resonance Expands ION Platform with New Functionality to Help Manufactures Automate their Supply Chains After building its workflow products to help manufacturing operators build great hardware on the factory floor and coordinate with engineering, First Resonance is introducing a number of features to help manufacturers manage a complex supply chain from parts purchase, to receipt, to inventory management. With these new features, engineers, certification auditors, quality teams, and more are able to quickly determine how to build products faster. The new ION Autoplan functionality will collect and analyze multiple complex signals and a large amount of data within existing inventory, the supply chain, purchase orders, and work in progress (WIP) to give manufacturers a forecast of what they need to do next to deliver their products on time. About First Resonance Headquartered in Los Angeles, California and run by a team of former engineers at SpaceX, JPL, Zoox, Toyota, First Resonance is breaking down the barriers between design, manufacturing, and product delivery with its ION manufacturing platform, so engineers building next generation hardware companies can move faster and continuously innovate on delivering better hardware to the world.

The company also announced a $40 million Series A funding round led by investors DCVC Bio and Northpond Ventures and supported by Camford Capital with original seed funding from Social Impact Capital. The Series A financing will be used to expand and scale Totus Medicines' proprietary drug discovery platform and advance the company's lead program into the clinic.Totus Medicines' TOS-358 drug program targets the PI3Kα mutation, which impacts more than 500,000 people in the U.S. every year and drives a significant percentage of breast, colon, lung, bladder, stomach, and other cancers. The pharmaceutical industry has spent decades and billions of dollars attempting to target PI3Kα, and current inhibitors only achieve moderate success in <10% of patients with PI3Kα-mutant cancers.In just 18 months, Totus has used its proprietary drug discovery platform to develop TOS-358, which shows strong preclinical efficacy across PI3Kα-mutant tumor types where current PI3Kα inhibitors show weak to no efficacy. In patient-derived mouse xenograft models, TOS-358 induces tumor regressions across breast, colon, lung, stomach, and other models, while current inhibitors show mild effects.

By combining this approach with breakthrough machine learning techniques, the company has developed the next generation of cellular analysis. Continuously learning and adapting, the Totus platform is more effective, less costly, and thousands of times faster than legacy drug discovery methods, enabling the rapid translation of therapies to patients. Totus aims to screen two billion compounds across the human genome within the next two years to unlock precise, effective drugs across hundreds of high-value drug targets.""The Series A financing will allow us to refine and grow the Totus platform to find new treatments for previously untreatable diseases—faster and more successfully than has ever been possible,"" said Jason Pontin, a Partner at DCVC, and a board member and co-founder of Totus Medicines.

IA Capital Group also participatedMore news about: The Demex Group","The Demex Group","WASHINGTON, Dec. 2, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- The Demex Group, the technology company behind a first-of-its-kind platform for analyzing, pricing, and transferring climate-linked risks at scale, today announced it has raised $9 million in Series A funding led by financial services and technology investors, Anthemis Group, Blue Bear Capital, and QBE Ventures. IA Capital Group also participated in this round of funding; both Anthemis and IA Capital led Demex's $4.2 million seed round announced a year ago. Extreme weather leads to dramatic fluctuations in revenue and operating costs for businesses around the world. These impacts are highly localized to each property, individualized for each occupant, and becoming more impactful than natural catastrophes. Climate resilience requires transcending the financial impact from catastrophic weather while also operating with everyday weather extremes. ""Property owners, tenants and managers are typically overlooked by the incumbent weather risk marketplace that focuses on agriculture and energy,"" stated Ed Byrns, CEO and Founder of The Demex Group. ""Recent advances in cloud computing, big data, and blockchain have enabled us to deliver a simple, secure, and scalable platform that's specifically designed for climate resiliency. We are thrilled to both retain our investors from the seed round and excited to be joined by Blue Bear Capital and QBE Ventures on our journey creating global climate resilience."" Weather-extremes are increasing, according to studies by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. ""During the first 6 months of 2021, there were 8 separate billion-dollar weather and climate disasters across the United States. 2020 set a record with 22 events - shattering the previous record of 16 events that occurred in 2011 and again in 2017."" In fact, the number of extreme weather events increased from 29 between in the decade 1981-1990 to 105 between 2011-2020. Anthemis' Ruth Foxe Blader said, ""The Demex Group is successfully designing products for clients seeking standalone protection for climate-linked financial exposures. Insurance carrier partners embed climate resiliency solutions into existing products, such as homeowners or business lines. API integration localizes real-time pricing at the property address- level within customer networks. For clients with nuanced financial exposures to weather, Demex's team of climate scientists analyze historical costs and revenues compared to extreme weather events and produce custom-fit expense models. We are thrilled to support this unique approach."" The Demex Climate Indicator recently launched as a free public resource for at-a-glance, easy-to- understand analysis of localized climate spanning multiple weather variables including summer-heat, winter-chill, rainfall, and snowfall. The Center includes over 650,000 unique climate assessments. ""We see an ecosystem teeming with new tools for 'climate intelligence' to help businesses understand the risk of volatile weather for their assets, operations and budgets. The question then becomes how to address that risk,"" stated Blue Bear Capital's Hank Hattemer, who joins the Demex Board of Directors. ""Demex has built a masterful answer to this question – the definitive platform for pricing and transferring complex weather risks that are ubiquitous yet behave in highly localized ways. The Demex team has the industry experience and product development expertise to scale its platform as managing climate and weather risk becomes standard protocol for CFOs and risk managers in virtually every industry.""About The Demex Group The world is changing; weather patterns are increasingly unstable and present unique risks for businesses. Extreme weather leads to dramatic fluctuations in revenue and operating costs. Yet existing financial weather risk management approaches were built for an earlier era and they are ill-equipped to reliably provide climate-linked financial security for property owners, tenants, and managers. Demex makes it simple to build protection for operational weather risks. Demex developed a robust, end-to-end ecosystem, seamlessly integrating the weather data, cashflow modeling and channel partners required to provide coverage that's tailored for businesses around the globe. Our team and technology were recognized in the top 50 insurtech companies in the Americas by InsurTech Insights and Oxbow Partners called us ""one of 25 emerging technology-led businesses well- placed to help insurers succeed.""

As part of its investment, Omega also prepaid $10 million to fund installations of SafelyYou across their 944 facilities.Also participating in the financing is SCAN Group, a mission-driven organization dedicated to keeping seniors healthy and independent. SCAN is supporting SafelyYou's growth in order to expand the availability of its fall management technology to a wider range of older adults. SCAN Group is the parent organization of SCAN Health Plan, one of the nation's largest not-for-profit Medicare Advantage plans.The two new strategic investors join existing investors Eclipse Ventures, Foundation Capital, Founders Fund, and DCVC, and the new round raised SafelyYou's venture funding total to approximately $70 million.Following the company's Series A raise earlier this year, the investor interest in doubling down on AI-enabled fall management – the detection and prevention of falls – speaks to the company's fast growth to date, and a growing need for technology to address patients with cognitive issues and aging Baby Boomers suffering from dementia. An estimated 1 in 3 seniors in America die with the condition.SafelyYou combines technology and professional caregiver intervention to not only detect a potentially injurious fall, but prevent future falls through AI-augmented pattern recognition and analysis. Only SafelyYou reviews over 1,500 videos of on-the-ground events per month, thereby harnessing data insights to provide personalized care plans for each individual.""My mission was to create a company that my Mom will need,"" said George Netscher, founder and CEO, SafelyYou. ""My mother lost her mother to Alzheimer's, and now my aunt has it. This is personal. Every fall that can be prevented means another son, daughter, sibling, friend or relative won't experience the suffering I witnessed. Seeing our technology being rapidly adopted by care centers across the country means we are helping prevent head injuries, hip fractures, and the associated stress, grief, and cost to caregivers and affected families.""""We were immediately attracted to the mission of SafelyYou, which is not only an innovator and industry leader, but also supports our focus on improving senior care facilities for both staff and residents,"" said Vikas Gupta, Senior Vice President, Acquisitions and Developments at Omega Healthcare Investors. ""SafelyYou reflects our passion for improving the lives of seniors, especially those who are most vulnerable – our residents suffering from various forms of cognitive impairment including Alzheimer's and dementia.""The funding announcement coincides with the release of a case study validating the benefit of deploying SafelyYou in 25 of Belmont Village Senior Living's memory care neighborhoods, which are designed as safe environments for residents with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. In Belmont Village, SafelyYou identified residents with a high likelihood of repeat falls and guided appropriate personalized care. As SafelyYou was deployed in the Belmont Village's communities over two years, the partners found the rate of fall-driven ER visits was down to just 4%, well below the industry average of 17-25%. Those findings are consistent with SafelyYou's averages – the platform helps reduce falls by 40% and ER visits resulting from falls by 80% – significantly decreasing costs, risks, and stress for both families and senior living communities.""We learned that by better seeing how we were responding to someone who has fallen, we could revamp and improve our training on a continuous basis,"" said Patricia Will, founder and CEO of Belmont Village. ""If you can mitigate fall risk, that's a huge win. After we looked at the results, we said, 'this is a technology that we're willing to implement across the company.'""In addition to fall detection and prevention, SafelyYou's technology assists caregivers with medication adherence, behavioral monitoring, management of false alarms, memory issues, and occupational therapy issues.About SafelyYouOriginating in 2015 as the doctoral research of CEO George Netscher—and inspired by his own family's experience with Alzhemier's disease—SafelyYou utilizes artificial intelligence to detect falls with unprecedented accuracy and provides fall video for root-cause analysis, empowering care staff to help prevent future falls. This innovation is combined with insights from SafelyYou fall experts, shaping a first-of-its-kind fall detection and prevention program. Specifically designed for memory care, or care for residents with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias, SafelyYou provides better support for unwitnessed falls by allowing for more informed ER decision-making. Today, this proven technology is successfully deployed in numerous communities in North America. Research results published in the American Journal of Managed Care revealed that real-time fall detection using SafelyYou's AI-enabled video recording reduced the need for emergency services by 80% in dementia care facilities.

Leucid is, in turn, one of Lonza's preferred collaborators on the Cocoon® Platform, and both companies will work together to optimise and streamline the manufacturing process for Leucid's CAR-T therapies. As a preferred collaborator, Leucid will have early access to new Cocoon® Platform technologies. Founded to translate 20 years of pioneering CAR-T research led by Dr John Maher at King's College London, Leucid has developed a proprietary engine that builds upon Dr Maher's novel parallel CAR-T model which positions these molecules in a more natural biological configuration. The Company's technology confers properties on the CART-cells that enable them to consistently outperform previous generations of CAR-T therapies in pre-clinical studies. As a result, this leads to enhanced T-cell potency and persistent long-term response with reduced toxicity.

The NKG2D receptor is an activating immune receptor that triggers cell death upon recognition of human NKG2D ligands expressed on transformed, infected or damaged cells.

Small businesses employ almost 47 percent of the nation's workforce.""Locally-owned small businesses are essential to the fabric of our communities,"" said Huntington's SBA Program Director, Maggie Ference. ""When small businesses succeed, so do individuals and communities. It becomes a rising tide for everyone.""In addition to providing vital goods and services, small businesses bring essential jobs to the communities they serve and drive economic development. From 1995 to 2020, small businesses accounted for 62 percent of net new job creation in the U.S., according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Because the health of local businesses and communities are so intertwined, Ference said it remains critical to shop local. ""We see local business owners continuing to work hard and innovate during this difficult time. It is such an inspiration and so important that we continue to show our support."" In addition to shopping in-person or online at favorite local establishments this holiday season, there are some other ways consumers can support local businesses, like sharing an experience on social media, writing reviews and seeking out new local businesses.While some of the hurdles for small businesses have changed compared to the 2020 holiday shopping season, it continues to be a critical time to think local.""Small businesses have faced one obstacle after another since the beginning of last year, and the current supply chain and labor challenges are just the latest,"" Ference said. ""But that shouldn't prevent shoppers from supporting their local businesses. Just plan ahead and have a little patience."" Huntington is committed to helping businesses thrive and ensuring its programs and support reflect the needs of people and businesses in its footprint.Huntington supporting small businesses with access to capitalWith the new year fast approaching, many entrepreneurs will begin pursuing their dream of starting a small business. This can be an exciting time, but one that is also filled with its share of uncertainty and challenges. For many of these entrepreneurs, one of the biggest challenges is securing the financing to start their business. Knowing the importance of small businesses to our communities, Huntington has invested in resources and programs to help business owners turn their dreams into reality. Building on its position as the nation's No. 1 Small Business Administration (SBA) 7(a) lender by volume, Huntington developed creative lending options and a variety of other features that will help bring relief, recovery and growth to small businesses.Recognizing the barriers to banking that exist for some small businesses, Huntington has made a commitment to support minority-, women- and veteran-owned small businesses as part of its Lift Local Business program. The program offers loans, business planning support and other services to help small business owners achieve their goals. In the first year of the program, Huntington booked $22 million in loans, helping more than 300 minority-, women- and veteran-owned small businesses. In June, Huntington announced a five-year, $100 million extension to this program.Huntington continues to invest in its communities to support economic inclusion and to help make its customers and its communities more financially secure in the future. In June, the bank announced a new strategy to tackle social, racial, environmental and economic inequities across its footprint by committing $40 billion toward its new Strategic Community Plan. This includes expanding its small business lending programs into its new footprint following the merger with TCF Financial Corporation and committing $10 billion over five years, of which $2 billion will focus on lending to minority-owned businesses or businesses operating in majority-minority communities.""The entrepreneurial spirit remains strong in this country, and everyone deserves an opportunity at financial success,"" said Ference. ""Access to capital is vital for those looking to start a new business or expand their existing business, and I'm so proud of the steps Huntington has taken to provide support for underserved businesses across our footprint.""Last year, Huntington launched its Support Local video series, a customer-inspired campaign that highlights the strength and resilience of small businesses across the Midwest. The campaign documents the real-life stories of small businesses and the conversations Huntington had with owners who found creative ways to manage their businesses and support their communities during the pandemic.How small businesses can protect themselves this holiday seasonAccording to a report from the Identity Theft Resource Center, 58 percent of small businesses have experienced at least one security or data breach. Recovering from a breach can also be expensive, with 60 percent of small businesses paying between $250,000 and $1 million to cover the costs.While many small business owners plan months ahead for the holiday shopping season, they do not always have the same level of preparedness for cybersecurity. Cyber criminals historically have taken advantage of the holiday season to attack consumers and businesses.To help prevent a cyberattack, businesses should educate and train employees on the latest scams, like social engineering and email phishing. Here are a few tips employers and employees should know:Avoid opening links or attachments on any email unless you are expecting them. Don't click on links from unknown sources and delete suspicious emails. On many systems, hover your mouse over a link (URL) without clicking it to display the link's full path, which will help you determine if a link is legitimate. When on the phone, always confirm who you are talking to and never provide personal information. Remember, caller-ID can be spoofed and never give out sensitive or personal information if you did not place the call. Always remember that your financial institution will never contact you to request your personal information, such as account numbers, passwords or one-time codes.Because many small businesses do not have access to cyberattack education, Huntington provides free resources to help take the worry out of your business becoming a victim. Additionally, Huntington offers cybersecurity insurance coverage that protects against loss and can help businesses minimize breaches by taking steps such as requiring dual approval on certain monetary transactions and advising on administrative changes.""Many businesses think a cyberattack won't happen to them, but the threat is very real,"" said Amy Geiger, Huntington's Chief Security Officer. ""An attack can be devastating, so it's important to have a plan in place and make sure employees know how they can do their part in keeping your business safe.""About HuntingtonHuntington Bancshares Incorporated is a $174 billion asset regional bank holding company headquartered in Columbus, Ohio.

Net cash used in operating activities for the quarter was US$46.1 million, or 53.8% of total revenue, compared to US$2.2 million, or 3.6% of total revenue in the third quarter of 2020. Shares repurchased in the form of ADSs for the quarter were approximately US$28.6 million, representing around 14.3% of the US$200 million authorization announced pursuant to the share repurchase program.Third Quarter 2021 Operating Highlights IoT PaaS Customers1 for the quarter of 2021 were approximately 3,000. Total customers for the quarter were approximately 4,500. Premium IoT PaaS customers2 for the trailing 12 months ended September 30, 2021 were 306. In the third quarter of 2021, the Company's premium IoT PaaS customers contributed approximately 89.2% of IoT PaaS revenue. Dollar-based net expansion rate3 of IoT PaaS was 179% for the trailing 12 months ended September 30, 2021, compared to 179% for the trailing 12 months ended September 30, 2020, remaining not less than 160% for eight consecutive quarters since the Company began tracking this metric for the trailing 12 months ended December 31, 2019. This demonstrates the Company's ability to expand customers' usage of the Tuya's platform over time and drive revenue growth from existing customers. IoT device and software developers, or developers, were over 446,000 as of September 30, 2021, up 70.2% from about 262,000 developers as of December 31, 2020.⸺⸺⸺⸺⸺⸺⸺⸺ 1. The Company defines an IoT PaaS customer for a given period as a customer who has directly placed orders for IoT PaaS with the Company during that period. 2. The Company defines a premium IoT PaaS customer as a customer as of a given date that contributed more than US$100,000 of IoT PaaS revenue during the immediately preceding 12-month period. 3. The Company calculates dollar-based net expansion rate of IoT PaaS for a trailing 12-month period by first identifying all customers in the prior 12-month period (i.e., those have placed at least one order for IoT PaaS during that period), and then calculating the quotient from dividing the IoT PaaS revenue generated from such customers in the current trailing 12-month period by the IoT PaaS revenue generated from the same group of customers in the prior 12-month period. Mr. Xueji (Jerry) Wang, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Tuya, commented, ""The third quarter of 2021 was a challenging quarter for the industry. Despite the impacts of global epidemic which caused volatile sequential growth and other global events, we still achieved roughly 45% year-over-year growth in our total revenues, which reached US$85.6 million, in line with our expectations and guidance. Our SaaS and others business segment, which are mainly To-Business services, achieved strong year-over-year growth of over 210%. During the quarter, we leveraged our industry leadership position and empowered our main customer groups to remain competitive amid macro adverse factors such as chip shortage and supply chain constraints; and were continuously making progress in each of our business aspects including the iteration and expansion of IoT PaaS products lines, industry SaaS, value-added services, and developer platform capabilities. Going forward, together with our existing strategies, the new initiatives are being implemented to better meet demand of customers worldwide. We are confident in our long-term prospects.""Ms. Yao (Jessie) Liu, Board Director and Chief Financial Officer of Tuya, added, ""Looking at our performance for a longer period which we believe will provide a better picture of our actual condition and long-term growth, our total revenue for the first three quarters of 2021 was US$227.1 million, up 94% year over year, and IoT PaaS revenue was US$199.3 million, up 105% year over year. During the third quarter of 2021, our gross margin achieved a steady quarter-over-quarter increase to 42.6%. As for operations, operating expenses for the quarter, excluding the impact of share-based compensation expenses, increased mainly due to our talent strategy. Building a large pool of qualified talents with a healthy personnel structure has positioned us well to tackle challenges of a changing external economic environment and its current and future impact on our workforce and long-term sustainable growth.""Third Quarter 2021 Unaudited Financial ResultsREVENUE Total revenue in the third quarter of 2021 increased by 44.9% to US$85.6 million from US$59.1 million in the same period of 2020, mainly driven by the increase in IoT PaaS revenue.IoT PaaS revenue in the third quarter of 2021 increased by 37.4% to US$72.6 million from US$52.8 million in the same period of 2020, primarily driven by stable growth in the number of SKUs and product categories supported by IoT PaaS, increased sales to existing customers, and the acquisition of new customers. SaaS and others revenue in the third quarter of 2021 increased by 214.2% to US$5.6 million from US$1.8 million in the same period of 2020, primarily due to the increasing demand from customers, including brands, business operators, etc., for sophisticated, brand-agnostic industry SaaS offerings and various value-added services. Smart device distribution revenue in the third quarter of 2021 increased by 66.0% to US$7.4 million from US$4.5 million in the same period of 2020, primarily due to the increased demand from customers for the specific smart devices directly sourced from original equipment manufacturers (""OEMs"") by the Company. The Company strategically positions smart device distribution as a way to improve the purchasing efficiency of smart devices for customers, primarily including brands and system integrators, who prefer not to deal with multiple OEMs. As a result, smart device distribution revenue is mainly affected by changes in customer purchase patterns and demand for smart devices which could fluctuate from period to period.COST OF REVENUECost of revenue in the third quarter of 2021 increased by 26.8% to US$49.1 million from US$38.8 million in the same period of 2020, primarily due to the growth of the Company's business.GROSS PROFIT AND GROSS MARGINTotal gross profit in the third quarter of 2021 increased by 79.2% to US$36.4 million from US$20.3 million in the same period of 2020.

General and administrative expenses in the third quarter of 2021 were US$18.2 million, up 314.8% from US$4.4 million in the same period of 2020, primarily due to the increase in share-based compensation expenses from US$1.4 million to US$11.6 million, the increase in employee-related costs, and professional services expenses.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresIn evaluating the business, the Company considers and uses non-GAAP measures, such as non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP loss from operations (including non-GAAP operating margin), non-GAAP net loss (including non-GAAP net margin), and non-GAAP basic and diluted net loss per ADS, as a supplemental measure to review and assess its operating performance. The presentation of the non-GAAP financial measure is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (""U.S. GAAP""). The Company defines non-GAAP measures by measures excluding the impact of share-based compensation expenses. The Company presents the non-GAAP financial measure because it is used by the management to evaluate the operating performance and formulate business plans. The Company also believes that the use of the non-GAAP measures facilitates investors' assessment of its operating performance.Non-GAAP measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and is not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. This non-GAAP financial measure has limitations as analytical tools. One of the key limitations of using aforementioned non-GAAP measures is that it does not reflect all items of expenses that affect the Company's operations. Share-based compensation expenses have been and may continue to be incurred in the business and are not reflected in the presentation of non-GAAP measures. Further, the non-GAAP measure may differ from the non-GAAP information used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore their comparability may be limited. The Company compensates for these limitations by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measures to the nearest U.S. GAAP performance measures, all of which should be considered when evaluating the Company's performance. The Company encourages you to review its financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure.Reconciliations of Tuya's non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable U.S. GAAP measures are included at the end of this press release.

Simply put, they need a single integrated platform to manage their watershed because every water decision is interlinked. Klir is that platform. Built for the water industry by water experts, Klir's cloud-based platform uses data analytics and task automation to help utilities capture widespread efficiency gains while ultimately protecting the environment. ""With Insight's backing and depth of expertise in building industry defining software, we can bring the experiences from other tech sectors to water management and apply it as a force for good,"" said David Lynch, CEO of Klir.

The funding round, led by Dragoneer Investment Group, is a landmark investment that has the potential to transform the care of older adults.More news about: UpStream Care","UpStream Care","UpStream Care Dragoneer Investment GroupGREENSBORO, N.C., Nov. 17, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- UpStream Care, a $1B+ healthcare company founded and chaired by pharmacist and healthcare entrepreneur Fergus Hoban, has landed $45M in new funding after the closure of its Series A round. The funding round, led by Dragoneer Investment Group, is a landmark investment that has the potential to transform the care of older adults. With the support of this investment, UpStream expects to triple in size within a year.UpStream Care's unique model offers support to practices of any size looking to participate in value-based care models. Traditionally, many practices do not have the experience or resources to take on the financial risks associated with value-based care models. Upstream's participating providers receive Guaranteed Advanced Payments for Quality or GAP-Q™ from UpStream based on their quality performance, reducing uncertainty for physicians in an otherwise unpredictable environment. ""We believe that primary care doctors are much more than deliverers of care to their older patients – they become themselves the instruments of care,"" said Hoban. ""Supporting their practices with the enhanced UpStream infrastructure means that they can deliver better care to older, sicker adults, who experience reduced obstacles to optimal care. UpStream takes on the management and risk responsibility for physicians, so they can focus solely on their patients' care.""UpStream Care brings together medical professionals such as doctors, nurses, dieticians, case managers, pharmacists, mobile paramedics, and other support staff to bring care to frail, medically complex patients in their own homes. ""We are a marketplace solution for independent primary care physicians,"" said Dr. Sanjay Doddamani, UpStream CEO. ""By focusing on patients living with chronic conditions, and physically embedding highly trained prescribing pharmacists and coordination nurses at each primary care physician office, we create the right infrastructure and resources for the whole-person care experience.""Doddamani continued: ""This is a win-win model. Patients win through better outcomes, personalized experience, and lower spending including out-of-pocket costs. Primary care physicians win through a collaborative model, ensuring the highest care and safety standards are met for patients living with chronic conditions, and much more stable practice cash flow. Payers win through dramatic improvements in quality, publicly reported outcomes, performance ratings, and better value through optimally managed medical costs.""""We are thrilled to back Fergus, Sanjay and the broader team at UpStream,"" said Eric Jones, partner at Dragoneer Investment Group. ""They have immense experience working with physicians in value-based care settings and have nailed an intervention model that improves outcomes, lowers cost and applies broadly across patient populations.""About UpStream CareUpStream Care is a nationally expanding risk bearing organization capable of dramatically improving outcomes for older adults living with chronic conditions. UpStream embeds clinical teams to support primary care physicians and networks with what they need to achieve high quality care and outcomes. With currently over 270 physicians contracted and over 100,000 seniors supported, UpStream is transforming from a regional to a national market leader in value-based care.

Innovation Endeavors led the round with participationMore news about: Machina Labs","Machina Labs","LOS ANGELES, Nov. 17, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Machina Labs, a pioneer in advanced manufacturing through robotics and artificial intelligence (AI), today emerged from stealth and announced it has closed a Series A round of financing, bringing the total raised to $16.3 million. Innovation Endeavors led the round with participation from Congruent Ventures and Embark Ventures. The funds will be used to significantly grow Machina's team in Los Angeles and to expand its R&D and manufacturing capacity to meet rapidly increasing customer demand.""Manufacturing must be reinvented to keep up with the pace of change in this highly competitive market,"" said Edward Mehr, Machina Labs CEO and co-founder. ""We're excited to finally reveal Machina Labs' manufacturing platform, which combines the latest advances in robotics and AI to democratize access to rapid manufacturing so that anyone with a great idea can manufacture parts quickly, efficiently and cost-effectively. These software-defined, robotic facilities are the factories of the future, and we're thrilled to have our investors on board to help us get there.""Founded in 2019 by an experienced team with deep domain expertise, Machina Labs has been working behind the scenes to blaze new trails in a manufacturing market that's ripe for disruption. Unlike the IT industry, with its embrace of rapid iteration and fast design lifecycle to accelerate innovation, manufacturing continues to rely on traditional processes that are rigid, slow and expensive. In some industries, the manufacturing design lifecycle can be as long as seven years — a major hurdle in product development. In the sheet metal forming industry, a current area of focus for Machina Labs, dies and stamping machines are multi-million-dollar investments, with design-specific tooling costs to set up a stamping line reaching up to $1 million for a single design. These impediments put manufacturing largely beyond the reach of all but a select few industrial giants.Some of Machina Labs' current customers are in the aerospace and defense industries. Having completed pilots with NASA and the U.S. Air Force, the company is now working on commercial engagements. With NASA, Machina Labs is working to achieve optimal efficiencies in tank design — something not easily done using traditional processes. The company is also delivering on its vision to create factories of the future not just on earth, but also in space. It has begun work with NASA on using its technology for in-space manufacturing — a necessary precursor to a multi-planetary future.With the U.S. Air Force, Machina Labs' technology is accelerating the development of composite molds and the production of parts in applications such as drones. The U.S. Air Force is investing in technologies that generate leap-ahead capabilities, and actively pursuing new and innovative ways to enable agile, affordable and accelerated functionality that ensures a global strategic advantage.Unlocking Manufacturing through AI and RoboticsMachina Labs is reinventing manufacturing plants by applying AI and robotics. Similar to an experienced craftsman using a hammer to create sheet metal parts, company robots use AI-driven sensor data to incrementally manipulate sheet metal to form parts. Machina Labs' Los Angeles factory provides flexible, on-demand, software-defined manufacturing-as-a-service to a variety of different industries, supporting rapid deployment and scale-up with no upfront investments in tooling. It even enables the remanufacturing of parts and components that are no longer in production, and for which machinery or dies are no longer available.Machina Labs also helps businesses overcome supply chain issues by bringing manufacturing to the United States. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, manufacturing has experienced a 60% increase in disruption during the COVID-19 pandemic — more than any other industry. This has triggered a push to move critical manufacturing processes stateside. But doing so introduces new problems when using traditional factories, such as higher-priced products due to companies' inability to take advantage of the cost efficiencies they enjoyed in other countries.Machina Labs makes it possible to eliminate many of these supply-chain bottlenecks through its cost-effective, fast and efficient manufacturing processes. This includes replacing capital expenditure costs in tooling and dies, while preserving and creating new jobs.""We're living through a critical moment in manufacturing and expect much to change coming out of the supply chain madness that COVID instigated. Manufacturers and end-product companies alike are looking for technology to help make them more efficient and adaptable. While these two goals were historically in tension, Machina Labs unlocks both,"" said Sam Smith-Eppsteiner, partner at Innovation Endeavors. ""We see huge opportunities for Machina Labs to disrupt engineering and design for metal parts, making the process faster and more iterative. But, we also believe that Machina will transform the production of parts for low- to mid-volume by reducing the manufacturing costs, time-to-market and inventory holding costs for tooling.""For Machina Labs, the market opportunity in reinventing sheet metal forming is significant. Based on an analysis of savings in material production, component manufacture and product use, Machina Labs' technology could save an estimated $12.3 billion per year in the U.S. when fully deployed.Machina Labs is looking to significantly expand its team in Los Angeles. Current employees have worked at America's most innovative companies and organizations, including SpaceX, Microsoft, Google, Northrop Grumman and Stratasys.

Angel investors joining this round include: Barr Moses (founder of Monte Carlo), Gene Lee (founder of Ramp), Maxime Beauchemin (the original creator of Airflow), and Alex Pall (The Chainsmokers).Hightouch co-founders Josh Curl (left), Kashish Gupta (center), and Tejas Manohar (right)This comes just months after announcing their Series A due to rapid customer acquisition, a new product (Hightouch Audiences), and the tailwinds of companies adopting cloud data warehouses and the modern data stack.The growth of the market and stellar customer interviews led investors to pre-empt the company's Series B. Since the Series A announcement, Hightouch has increased revenue by more than twofold and grown the team from four employees at the beginning of the year to thirty today. Hightouch has hundreds of customers, including Fortune 500 companies. This year, Hightouch has partnered with B2C brands like Betterment, EyeByeDirect, Imperfect Foods, Autotrader, and Nando's, as well as B2B companies like Plaid, Ramp, CircleCI, Lucidchart, and SurveyMonkey. ""Our vision is to make data accessible and useful to everyone within a company,"" said Kashish Gupta, co-founder of Hightouch. ""This new round of funding allows us to invest heavily in our product to add features that data engineers love, as well as UIs that make Hightouch accessible to different verticals of business users, starting with marketers and expanding into sales, customer success, and support.""Every business team - sales, marketing, support, success - needs customer data in the software they use to talk to customers, like CRMs, email tools, ad tools, and billing tools. Hightouch is the easiest way to sync that data between systems without engineering help.Between the Series A and now, Hightouch overhauled their core product to make it enterprise ready by adding access control, SSO, version control, and the ability to handle the throughput of millions of rows of data that their Fortune 500 customers send every day.Hightouch has also partnered with Snowflake, solidifying a foothold as the go-to product for data activation from the data warehouse. They have also developed key partnerships with companies like Amplitude and Outreach that have endorsed Hightouch as the de facto way to transfer data into their applications, either for initial implementation or enhancement of customer data. These are in addition to existing partnerships with modern data stack leaders like dbt, Fivetran, and Snowplow.In the past few months, Hightouch released their second product, Hightouch Audiences, which lets anyone define what data they need in their tools, regardless of whether they know SQL or not. With Hightouch Audiences, marketers can self-serve data for their campaigns. Public companies like Autotrader, the largest car marketplace in the UK, use Audiences to send data to ad networks and email tools for hyper-personalization, faster experimentation, and increased customer conversion. ""We have so much valuable data in our data warehouse. Before using Hightouch, getting that data into other tools was painful and time-consuming. With Hightouch, we can put data to use so quickly and easily,"" said Tim Jenkins, senior director of strategy and analytics at Lucidchart. ""Hightouch has opened up all kinds of use cases, such as sending real-time notifications of new opportunities to Slack, sending custom audience lists to ad platforms such as Adwords and Bing to enable targeted advertising, and sending product activity data into Marketo for personalized email campaigns—and we're just scratching the surface!""As pioneers of the Reverse ETL space, Hightouch will use their latest round of funding to double-down on their investment in product and engineering. The money will be used to expand the surface area of who the product serves, and further improve the core developer experience. Their goal is to build out a sizable team that is capable of delivering Hightouch to as many companies as possible.About HightouchFounded by early employees of Segment, Hightouch is the world's leading Reverse ETL platform, which syncs data from data warehouses to various SaaS tools. Hightouch was founded on the notion that every business team—sales, marketing, support, success—needs relevant, accurate, and real-time customer data in the software they use to talk to customers including CRM, email, and support platforms. With data warehouses as the hub for customer data, Hightouch has pioneered the concept of reverse ETL, which is the easiest way to get data out of data warehouses and into those customer-facing operational systems. Hightouch is based in San Francisco and backed by leading investors such as ICONIQ Growth, Amplify Partners, Bain Capital Ventures, Y-Combinator, and Afore Capital.

The report tracks a smaller subset of startups receiving seed- and early-stage investment from top performing VC firms. In this third iteration of the report, PitchBook's Institutional Research Group tracked 189 early- and seed-stage deals that involved the top 15 VC firms. These firms are determined each quarter based on the success of their investments over time, in terms of exits and valuations. According to the analysis, top performing VCs are chasing emerging technology deals, deploying $6 billion across 189 deals in Q3 2021, the highest amount on record.To download PitchBook's Q3 2021 Emerging Technology Indicator, click here. ""Investment activity across early-stage emerging technologies is another proof point of frenetic VC environment,"" said Paul Condra, head of emerging technology research at PitchBook. ""Emerging tech deal sizes tend to run 3x to 5x larger than median deal sizes across the entire VC industry, which is driven by several factors, including the tendency for our ETI investor cohort to be larger, multi-stage investors; their ability to obtain larger stakes in startups, and the higher likelihood of co-investment resulting in larger rounds. Investors are also closely monitoring current events driving market and economic trends, resulting in changes in the top five sectors attracting investment."" In Q3 2021, there were 14 early and seed stage deals over $100 million, up from eight deals in Q2 2021 and significantly higher than the historical quarterly average of three dating back through 2015. Compared to ETI deal trends on a cumulative four-quarter basis, Q3 deal activity was notable for several reasons, including the surge in Web3 & DeFi funding as well as the strong quarter for supply chain tech and the relatively low investment quarter for health and wellness tech and biotechnology.See below some key takeaways from the investment activity in Q3 2021:The top three deals included a $900 million Series B for crypto trading platform and NFT marketplace FTX, a $250 million round for blockchain-based gaming platform Dapper Labs, and a $170 million Series A for ultra-fast grocery delivery platform JOKR. The top five areas of technology investment in Q3 included Web3 & DeFi ($1.3 billion), fintech ($860 million), enterprise SaaS ($493 million), supply chain tech ($454 million), and gaming ($387 million). Web3 & DeFi was a standout segment of investment in Q3 with $1.3 billion invested across 12 deals, by far the largest amount we have tracked in a quarter. Key trends driving investment in the sector, include the growth of marketplaces for trading cryptocurrencies and NFTs, continued fund formation from high-profile investors, and steady development of new protocols and DeFi projects. Enterprise SaaS attracted more $493 million VC dollars in Q3. While providers in this segment run the gamut of enterprise use cases, Q3 was notable for startups focused on recruiting, onboarding, and other employee management functions. Supply chain tech was the fourth largest segment of ETI investment, generating $454 million in deal value. While investment value was driven by a few larger deals, increased investment activity in supply chain startups is expected to persist in the coming quarters, particularly in startups focused on tech-driven sourcing and delivery tools.To download PitchBook's Emerging Technology Indicator, click here.

Additional new investors include Cowen Healthcare Investments, Decheng Capital, Marshall Wace, OrbiMed, RTW Investments, LP, Samsara BioCapital, Tybourne Capital Management, and venBio Partners. ACELYRIN also announced it has entered into an agreement with Affibody AB to develop and commercialize izokibep, a unique, antibody mimetic, interleukin-17A (IL-17A) inhibitor designed to overcome the limitations of monoclonal antibodies and provide potential for meaningfully differentiated efficacy in several autoimmune diseases. The exquisite potency and small size of izokibep enables enhanced tissue penetration and high exposures in a single subcutaneous injection; exposures monoclonal antibodies require IV administration to approach. The proceeds from the Series B financing will be used to fund licensing and acquisition of additional programs, with a focus in immunology, and accelerate the development of izokibep. ""We are pleased this syndicate of blue-chip investors has committed to ACELYRIN and our mission to identify, license, and develop transformative therapies for patients with serious diseases and unmet needs,"" said Shao-Lee Lin, MD, PhD, co-founder and chief executive officer (CEO) of ACELYRIN. ""This financing catalyzes our ability to rapidly advance the late-phase development of izokibep and demonstrate its potential for differentiation within the class of IL-17 inhibitors, both by unlocking new indications as well as achieving differentiated efficacy in existing blockbuster indications, where significant unmet needs persist. The financing also catapults our ability to proactively build the company and aggressively pursue the expansion of our portfolio to meaningfully improve patients' lives."" ""As the lead Series A investor, we want to thank and welcome this impressive group of Series B investors in joining us to support ACELYRIN.

""We believe izokibep is the first of many assets that the company will develop to transform patients' lives, and we are excited to be a partner in that journey along with the other investors and management team.""The Company is currently enrolling izokibep in a pivotal trial for the treatment of uveitis, a vision-threatening form of inflammation inside the eye, and a Phase 2b trial for the treatment of axial spondyloarthritis (AS), a chronic form of arthritis that primarily affects the spine and enthesites, specialized tissue that connects ligaments and tendons to bone. In addition, ACELYRIN plans to initiate a Phase 2b trial for hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), a devastating, chronic inflammatory disease of the exocrine sweat glands characterized by painful, malodorous nodules and abscesses in the axilla, groin, and gluteal areas that can become scarred and disfiguring.

With extraordinary potency and small molecular size, izokibep can reach high drug exposure levels through a single subcutaneous injection that monoclonal antibodies require IV administration to achieve. In addition, the molecule's small size—about a tenth the size of a monoclonal antibody—also enables its potential to reach targeted tissues that may otherwise be inaccessible to the much larger monoclonal antibodies. More than 300 patients have been exposed to izokibep to date, many for up to three years. These data confirm the safety profile of izokibep and support the strategy of fully evaluating IL-17A inhibition in pursuit of transformative efficacy across many disease states.

This comes just a year after Pigment's Series A and the company's promise to reboot the spreadsheet. Pigment's intuitive platform, which anyone can use and understand in minutes, allows leaders and analysts to understand all of their business data better and anticipate the impact of their decisions with unprecedented speed and flexibility.Eléonore Crespo and Romain Niccoli, co-founders of Pigment (PRNewsfoto/Pigment)A finance dashboard built on the Pigment platform. (PRNewsfoto/Pigment)A business overview dashboard built on the Pigment platform. (PRNewsfoto/Pigment)The investment was led by US heavyweight Greenoaks with Series A investors participating, including New York-based FirstMark Capital and Blossom Capital. Pigment will use the funds to hire employees and increase resources to meet massive demand from clients, and to expand their footprint in the US and European markets.For too long, Finance and Business teams have had to adapt to expensive and complex tools or error-prone Excel spreadsheets to understand their business, operating in isolation from the rest of their company's functions. But in a remote-first world, the need for online collaboration capabilities that allow true team alignment has never been stronger. Since its Series A in December 2020, Pigment has further developed their platform to allow any leader in an organisation to adopt a common language around the numbers that matter, and to work on them in real time with their teams. The platform has native integrations with Workday, Netsuite, Salesforce and many other SaaS solutions. The platform is seeing rapid uptake. In less than a year, Pigment has signed some of Europe's fastest growing businesses, including ManoMano, Melio, Deliveroo, Spendesk, Blablacar, and Cheerz. Those companies chose Pigment to inform important business decisions under the tight timeframes required of the competitive space they operate in: validating and tracking hiring plans across fast-growing teams, expanding - or deciding not to - in new markets, defining new customer segmentation, raising a new round or planning an IPO. In addition, Pigment's potential is drawing top talent. Tech hotshots Julien Lesaicherre and Rebeca Tristan recently left Facebook – where they were in charge of Workplace's success - to join the Pigment mission as Head of Business and Head of Customer Experience, respectively. The company aims to triple the size of their business team by Q1 22.Pigment has grand ambitions for the US market, having just signed new flagship US clients, Melio, Algolia, and Gong, one of the fastest growing US sales companies. Pigment plans to open US offices in New York and Silicon Valley, hiring across all sales and support functions in 2022.Eléonore Crespo & Romain Niccoli, Co-Founders and Co-CEOs of Pigment, said: ""In every category from sales to marketing, innovation has happened - but the most strategic decisions still rely on analysts spending long, painful hours on Excel. We want to help fast growth companies see, understand, and imagine the full spectrum of their business by creating a common language around the numbers that matter. And the proof we're succeeding in that goal can be seen in our client's recent successes!""Neil Shah, Partner at Greenoaks Capital, said: ""Financial planning & analysis is a critical business function. But today, most companies rely on software that hasn't evolved in years — either outdated spreadsheets that are inflexible and don't scale, or expensive and overly-complex FP&A suites that require an industry of consultants to support them. Today's businesses demand agile and intelligent tools that will help them make better decisions more quickly. That's why we were excited to meet Pigment, which is bringing a world-class engineering team and an exceptional product to a timely problem. We believe that the company will rapidly become the market's clear leader in planning software, building faster and for broader use cases than any competitor, and delighting their customers along the way. Greenoaks is thrilled to partner with them at this exciting moment in their journey."" Paul Melchiorre, former CEO of business planning giant Anaplan, said: ""I've been in the enterprise planning business since my time at SAP in the early 1990s. I recently led the largest player in the space, and I can honestly say that Pigment's platform is the most flexible and comprehensive. Pigment will be transformative for the start-up ecosystem because it will be at the core of successful and sustainable growth strategies, tailor made for the next generation of leaders. It will allow them to deliver on high expectations set by increasing levels of funding, and plan for uncertain scenarios while being socially and environmentally mindful.""Herut Uval, Strategic Finance lead at Melio, said: "" After previously using many different planning tools, I can confidently say Pigment's UI is one of the strongest I have seen, allowing our team to understand and use everything very efficiently. Thanks to Pigment, we've been able to automate our reforecast process and easily add new products in our models, which enables us to better anticipate our future P&L to support our growth in the US market. We've recently raised $250 million in a ripe market for payments solutions and our monthly processing volumes have surged 5,000% over the past 18 months. In order for us to make timely decisions that support our growth in the long term we need an agile business planning platform - which is exactly what Pigment provides."" Jonathan Christodoulides, Head of FP&A at Deliveroo, said: ""Following the recent IPO, Deliveroo needed to find a financial planning tool that would help us achieve our ambitious growth, at scale and sustainably - we had outgrown Gsheets and Excel for our planning process. We chose Pigment because they are the only tool on the market that can be implemented quickly, intuitively and flexibly, that is powerful enough to handle complex planning and forecasting needs, and that can allow our entire team to work as one. Our Financial Planning & Analysis team used to spend a significant amount of time preparing or collating data and less time analysing or providing new scenarios. Thanks to Pigment, we are moving towards a world where we spend more time adding value.""Note to the editorsAbout PigmentPigment was founded in 2019 by Eléonore Crespo, a former data analyst at Google and investor at preeminent European venture capital firm Index Ventures, and Romain Niccoli, the former CTO and co-founder of Criteo – the ad-tech company that is one of Europe's most prominent tech success stories, following a successful NASDAQ IPO in 2013 and annual revenues of over $2 billion USD. Crespo and Niccoli identified three key roadblocks in planning and reporting. One was a lack of transparency and insight into underlying data behind their business; two was the sheer quantity of data they had to get their head around; and three was the static way it was presented, which made it hard to change and manipulate. As a result, planning and reporting wastes a lot of time and money, and the inevitable mistakes hamper almost all organisations – as shown by reports in 2020 that an error in a UK government spreadsheet caused many thousands of Covid-19 cases to go unreported, when an Excel file reached its maximum size and failed to update. By contrast, Pigment's technology offers an intuitive, visually-driven experience that lets you play with different parameters and do continuous forecasting – animating future scenarios and bringing them to life through charts, models and simulations. This allows you to see your business clearly, to take control over its dynamics and to make strategic decisions in real time.

For more information, visit www.korewireless.com.Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresIn addition to our results determined in accordance with GAAP, we believe the following non-GAAP measures are useful in evaluating our operational performance. We use the following non-GAAP financial information to evaluate our ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe that non-GAAP financial information, when taken collectively, may be helpful to investors in assessing our operating performance.EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA""EBITDA"" is defined as net income (loss) before other non-operating expense or income, income tax expense or benefit, and depreciation and amortization. ""Adjusted EBITDA"" is defined as EBITDA adjusted for unusual and other significant items that management views as distorting the operating results from period to period. Such adjustments may include stock-based compensation, integration and acquisition-related charges, tangible and intangible asset impairment charges, certain contingent liability reversals, transformation, and foreign currency transaction gains and losses. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are intended as supplemental measures of our performance that are neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. We believe that the use of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing the Company's financial measures with those of comparable companies, which may present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. However, you should be aware that when evaluating EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA we may incur future expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. In addition, our presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our computation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies may not calculate Adjusted EBITDA in the same fashion.Because of these limitations, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA on a supplemental basis. You should review the reconciliation of net loss to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA below and not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business. Key MetricsKORE reviews a number of metrics to measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, prepare financial projections, and make strategic decisions. The calculation of the key metrics and other measures discussed below may differ from other similarly titled metrics used by other companies, securities analysts, or investors.Number of Customer ConnectionsTotal Customer Connections or ""Total Connections"" constitutes the total of all KORE Connectivity services connections, including both CaaS and CEaaS connections, but excluding certain connections where mobile carriers license KORE's subscription management platform from KORE. Total Connections include the contribution of eSIMs and is the principal measure used by management to assess the performance of the business on a periodic basis.DBNERDBNER (Dollar Based Net Expansion Rate) tracks the combined effect of cross-sales of IoT Solutions to KORE's existing customers, its customer retention and the growth of its existing business. KORE calculates DBNER by dividing the revenue for a given period (""given period"") from existing go-forward customers by the revenue from the same customers for the same period measured one year prior (""base period""). The revenue included in the current period excludes revenue from (i) customers that are non go-forward customers, meaning customers that have either communicated to KORE before the last day of the current period their intention not to provide future business to KORE or customers that KORE has determined are transitioning away from KORE based on a sustained multi-year time period of declines in revenue and (ii) new customers that started generating revenue after the end of the base period. For example, to calculate our DBNER for the trailing 12 months ended September 31, 2021, we divide (i) revenue, for the trailing 12 months ended September 31, 2021, from go-forward customers that started generating revenue on or before September 31, 2020 by (ii) revenue, for the trailing 12 months ended September 31, 2020, from the same cohort of customers. For the purposes of calculating DBNER, if KORE acquires a company during the given period or the base period, then the revenue of a customer before the acquisition but during either the given period or the base period is included in the calculation. Further, it is often difficult to ascertain which customers should be deemed not to be go-forward customers for purposes of calculating DBNER. Customers are not required to give notice of their intention to transition off of the KORE platform, and a customer's exit from the KORE platform can take months or longer, and total connections of any particular customer can at any time increase or decrease for any number of reasons, including pricing, customer satisfaction or product fit – accordingly, a decrease in total connections may not indicate that a customer is intending to exit the KORE platform, particularly if that decrease is not sustained over a period of several quarters. DBNER would be lower if it were calculated using revenue from non go-forward customers.As of September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020, DBNER excludes connections from non go-forward customers, the vast majority of which are connections from Non-Core Customers. KORE defines ""Non-Core Customers"" to be customers that management has judged to be lost as a result of the integration of Raco, Wyless and other acquisitions completed during in the 2014-2017 period, but which continue to have some connections (and account for some revenue) each year with KORE. Non-Core Customers are a subset of non go-forward customers.DBNER is used by management as a measure of growth at KORE's existing customers (i.e., ""same store"" growth). It is not intended to capture the effect of either new customer wins or the declines from non go-forward customers on KORE's total revenue growth. This is because DBNER excludes new customers which started generating revenue after the base period, and also excludes any customers which are non go-forward customers on the last day of the current period. Revenue increases from new customer wins, and a decline in revenue from non go-forward customers are also important factors in assessing KORE's revenue growth, but these factors are independent of DBNER.Cautionary Note on Forward-Looking StatementsThis press release includes certain statements that are not historical facts but are forward-looking statements for purposes of the safe harbor provisions under the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Third Quarter Financial Highlights Third quarter 2021 Total revenue of $77.6 million, up from $13.3 million in the comparable prior year period Year-to-date Total revenue reached $165.3 million, up from $44.6 million in the comparable prior year period, an increase of 271% Third quarter 2021 Foundry revenue of $34.7 million, up from $11.5 million in the comparable prior-year period, an increase of 202% Year-to-date Foundry revenue totaled $78.8 million, up from $42.8 million in the comparable prior-year period, an increase of 84% Third quarter revenue includes an equity milestone payment from Cronos for commercial-scale production of CBG Third quarter 2021 Biosecurity revenue of $42.9 million continuing strong growth trajectory with gross profit margins expanding to 48% Year-to-date Biosecurity revenue of $86.5 million compares to our prior full year outlook of at least $75 million Third quarter 2021 Loss from operations of -$26.7 million, improved from -$34.4 million in the comparable prior-year period Year-to-date Loss from operations of -$143.7 million, down from -$81.1 million in the comparable prior-year period Third quarter 2021 Adjusted EBITDA of -$18.0 million, improved from -$30.6 million in the comparable prior-year period Year-to-date Adjusted EBITDA of -$106.6 million, down from -$70.7 million in the comparable prior year period Cash and cash equivalents balance as of the end of the third quarter of $1.7 billion puts Ginkgo in an extremely strong financial position to pursue its strategic objectives 2021 Full Year Outlook Ginkgo expects to add an incremental 9 programs in Q4 2021, for a total of 30 new programs in the year Ginkgo expects total Foundry revenue of at least $100 million for full year 2021, inclusive of both downstream value share and services revenue While Biosecurity remains an uncertain business, Ginkgo has already exceeded its previous full year outlook for Biosecurity and now expects Biosecurity revenue to be at least $110 million for the full year Ginkgo shares conclusions from internal investigation, led by independent law and accounting firms, concluding that short seller claims were unfounded As a leader in an emerging field that is innovating on multiple fronts, we are used to folks questioning our capabilities and our valuation and, because those questions are typically in good faith, we welcome those discussions. In October however, a short seller with a vested interest in driving down our stock price for financial gain published an inflammatory report claiming financial misconduct by Ginkgo. Due to the nature of the claims in the short report, it was not entirely surprising that shortly after the short report was released, we also received an informal inquiry from the United States Department of Justice. Ginkgo responded seriously to the claims in the short report and our audit committee proactively commenced a thorough independent investigation, led by top independent counsel (Milbank) and forensic accountants (Ankura) with deep expertise in these matters. This investigation has concluded and found that any suggestion of fraud, reporting violations, accounting errors, or other wrongdoing contained in the short seller's report were unfounded and that no restatement of Ginkgo's financials was needed. Additional Information on Equity Matters The company's Certificate of Incorporation provides that up to 10% of non-Founder employee equity awards are not subject to transfer restrictions, and the company expects the Board of Directors to settle the portion of such equity awards that represent restricted stock units for cash during the fourth quarter of 2021. As previously disclosed, 90% of employee equity awards are subject to a full one-year lockup, subject to certain exceptions, such as selling shares to satisfy tax obligations. The vesting and settlement of these shares is expected to occur over the fourth quarter of 2021 and first quarter of 2022 to minimize the number of shares being sold to cover taxes on any given day. Presentation Information Ginkgo will host a presentation reviewing the results for the third quarter of 2021 today, Monday, November 15, 2021, beginning at 8:00am ET. The presentation will include an overview of third quarter 2021 financial performance, recent business updates, a discussion on Ginkgo's outlook, as well as a moderated question and answer session.

Operating ExpensesTotal operating expenses for the quarter ended September 30, 2021, were $7.4 million, compared to $3.7 million for the comparable quarter of 2020. The increase in operating expenses was primarily due to the gain of $1.6 million (which reduced expenses) recorded during the quarter ended September 30, 2020, as a result of the Vyleesi Termination Agreement with AMAG Pharmaceuticals, and secondarily to increased commercial expenses related to Vyleesi. Cash FlowsPalatin's net cash used in operations for the quarter ended September 30, 2021, was $6.4 million, compared to net cash provided by operations of $3.8 million for the same period in 2020.

There are five melanocortin receptors, MC1r through MC5r. Modulation of these receptors, through use of receptor-specific agonists, which activate receptor function, or receptor-specific antagonists, which block receptor function, can have medically significant pharmacological effects.Many tissues and immune cells located in the eye (and other places, for example the gut and kidney) express melanocortin receptors, empowering our opportunity to directly activate natural pathways to resolve disease inflammation.About Palatin Palatin is a biopharmaceutical company developing first-in-class medicines based on molecules that modulate the activity of the melanocortin and natriuretic peptide receptor systems, with targeted, receptor-specific product candidates for the treatment of diseases with significant unmet medical need and commercial potential. Palatin's strategy is to develop products and then form marketing collaborations with industry leaders to maximize their commercial potential.

To deliver on its mission to buildMore news about: Ultimate","Ultimate","BERLIN, Nov. 15, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Ultimate, the #1 customer support automation platform according to G2 customer reviews, is today celebrating a series of expansion milestones on the eve of its 5th birthday, with two new executives joining to lead go-to-market expansion globally, a record-breaking Q3, and continued product innovation in the application of AI to solve costly problems in customer service.To spearhead global growth Henrique Moniz de Aragao joins as EVP, Sales with Will McInnes joining as Chief Marketing Officer. Aragao joins to lead Ultimate's commercial teams following a highly successful period of >100% year-on-year growth at G2 as General Manager of the EMEA business, leading new market entry and expansion across the region. G2 recently raised $157m Series D at a $1.1bn valuation. McInnes joins after 7 years as an executive at Brandwatch based in NYC, USA and Brighton, UK, scaling from $20m revenues to $105m culminating in a successful exit to Cision in June this year.Reflecting on these two senior go-to-market appointments, CEO & Co-Founder Reetu Kainulainen said ""Henrique and Will bring deep expertise in scaling internationally and the domain expertise to lead their respective areas - we've been growing fast, now with them onboard we have the leadership team in place to double down on our market-leading approach"".In Q3, the company celebrated 120% growth against target, acquiring new brands including Vodafone, Gorillas & F-Secure in addition to strong organic customer expansion, with one global Fortune 500 brand expanding by 600%+. The company's partnerships are scaling too: Ultimate is partnering with hyper-growth startup Dixa to provide a best-in-class automation experience as both companies rapidly grow their US market presence.In October virtual agents powered by Ultimate automated 43% of all interactions, delivering faster resolutions for consumers - by collecting and validating customer information, automatically responding to customer inquiries and automating back office processes - while presenting human agents with the prioritized customer care issues that most needed their support.Deploying funds from its $20M Series A in December 2020, Ultimate now numbers over 109 full-time employees across the globe. To deliver on its mission to build the most powerful platform in the industry the company continues to invest substantially in innovation - with over half of all team members in R&D, and a commitment to substantial quarterly product releases. In Q3 the company launched a pioneering Training Center, giving non-technical customer support teams an intuitive, no-code toolset for training their virtual agents. Prior to this, product launches centered around an industry-leading Impact Report, providing a data-driven roadmap of automation priorities based on historical support data, and a brand-new Ticket Automation product, using AI to free up human agents from the most repetitive support ticket tasks.With an eye on continued acceleration in 2022, CEO Reetu Kainulainen said: ""Since raising Series A 11 months ago we have been intensely focused on execution: our team is now 3x the size, our customers are rolling out our platform to new territories and languages, and with these two new revenue leaders and our first sales team in the US hired we are incredibly excited. But - and there is a but - this market is huge and accelerating. Improving the way customer service happens globally is an absolutely massive opportunity and one we are committed to for the long haul, so even with the excitement we are also feeling like we're just a fraction of the way towards our end goal"".About UltimateUltimate's AI-powered virtual agent platform helps customer support teams to reduce costs and increase customer satisfaction.

Integrated Capital led the round with participation from Great Oaks Venture Capital, Pacific Tiger Group, Sope Creek Capital and Clearco. The Naked Market ProductsThe Naked Market Founders (Harrison Fugman, Alex Kost)The Naked Market was founded in 2019 by Harrison Fugman, Alex Kost and Tim Marbach with a mission to create better-for-you food brands that meet the shifting interests and demands of today's consumers. Through the use of its internal tech tool, The Machine, The Naked Market has developed the infrastructure and end-to-end expertise to conceptualize ideas and bring them to market within two to three months, with all elements from ideation to distribution handled in-house. Since inception, The Naked Market has created five (5) unique brands including Flock Chicken Chips, AvoCrazy, Project Breakfast and Beach House Bowls. Its latest brand launch, Rob's Backstage Popcorn, is a joint venture with the global pop sensation, Jonas Brothers. With this new influx of capital, which is a mix of equity and debt, The Naked Market will focus on in-house incubation (both internal brands & celebrity products), scaling existing brands and opportunistic acquisitions. ""While the demand for better-for-you products that meet a variety of dietary needs is at an all-time high, most consumers rarely see the full range of options available to them because big box brands tend to churn out items based on their legacy infrastructure and not today's consumer needs,"" said Harrison Fugman, Co-Founder and CEO of The Naked Market. ""Having developed a platform that is optimized for new age consumers and differentiated sales channels, specifically digital, we can compete against the big incumbents in a much faster and more resource-efficient manner,"" added Alex Kost, Co-Founder and COO.""The Naked Market has built a unique portfolio model that allows the team to hone in on multiple snack products that not only lead with superior flavor and better ingredients, but are at the forefront of trends as they emerge,"" said Jeffrey Yam, Executive Director at Hong Kong-based Integrated Capital. ""The technology and infrastructure they have built to create and scale multiple brands is something we believe will catapult them to being the next big incumbent in the food and beverage sector.""At the core of that tech is a proprietary data tool called The Machine, which leverages more than 15 million data points collected from Shopify, direct customer feedback, Amazon, retail point of sale, and search engine trends, all of which help inform the category opportunities the company pursues. A direct customer feedback loop also allows The Naked Market to gain an understanding of what consumers are or are not enjoying and purchasing from its own portfolio, identifying winners and quickly scaling them to become household names. On the opposite end, The Naked Market also applies a ""fail fast"" approach to brands that may not be resonating. Just as quickly as a new brand is scaled, so too can a brand be shut down swiftly to better utilize resources towards the brands consumers respond to most. This way, every brand and product within The Naked Market's portfolio is innovative and truly driven by consumer demand, and is set up to meet today's consumer needs efficiently and effectively.

Ltd. from GSR Ventures and Square Peg Capital Pty. Ltd. in its series A funding round in September 2020, for operational expansion in New Zealand and More news about: P&S Intelligence","P&S Intelligence","NEW YORK, Nov. 11, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- The Australian micromobility market revenue stood at $16.9 million in 2020, and it is set to surge to $19,185.6 million by 2030, at a CAGR of 89.5% from 2021 to 2030. The major growth drivers for the market are the convenience and low price of micromobility services and burgeoning need for better first- and last-mile connectivity. Additionally, the increasing road congestion in urban areas is positively impacting the Australian micromobility market. Due to the mushrooming population, the number of daily commuters is surging rapidly, which is causing road congestion, particularly during the peak hours. As per the World Bank, Australia's urban population soared to 22.1 million in 2020 from 20.4 million in 2015. This has augmented the burden on conventional transportation systems and pushed up the requirement for more-convenient and -efficient mobility options, such as micromobility. Get the sample pages of this report at: https://www.psmarketresearch.com/market-analysis/australia-micromobility-market/report-sampleKey Findings of Australia Micromobility Market ReportE-scooters dominated the Australian micromobility market in the past, within the vehicle type segment. The soaring popularity of these vehicles, especially for recreational and short-distance traveling, has propelled the category's revenue. The first- and last-mile category contributed the higher revenue to the Australian micromobility market in the years gone by, under the model segment. This was because of the surging requirement for better first- and last-mile connectivity. The battery swapping technology is trending in the Australian micromobility space as it reduces the vehicle purchase costs and, ultimately, makes the services cheaper for consumers. An investment of $12.0 million was raised by Neuron Mobility Pte. Ltd. from GSR Ventures and Square Peg Capital Pty. Ltd. in its series A funding round in September 2020, for operational expansion in New Zealand and Australia. Beam Mobility Holdings Pte. Ltd. raised $26.0 million from Hana Ventures and Sequoia India in a new financing round in June 2020, to provide diversified services in various Asia-Pacific (APAC) nations, such as Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan, and South Korea.Browse detailed report on Australia Micromobility Market Size, Trend and Industry Growth Forecast to 2030The COVID-19 pandemic has created immense growth opportunities for the players operating in the Australian micromobility market, owing to the growing public preference for micromobility over crowded public transit systems, such as buses and metro trains. Additionally, the government is providing strong support to micromobility by launching initiatives aimed at developing dedicated parking areas even in the cities' busiest parts.Neuron Mobility Pte.

Her investment in More news about: Emergence Capital","Emergence Capital","SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 10, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Emergence Capital, the leading venture firm focused on early-stage enterprise software companies, today announced the promotions of Lotti Siniscalco to Partner and Yaz El-Baba to Senior Associate. As exemplary members of the firm's investment team, Lotti and Yaz are committed to identifying emerging enterprise software trends, connecting with entrepreneurial visionaries, and serving as the most important partner to the founders and companies that Emergence backs. Lotti Siniscalco has been promoted to Partner and Yaz El-Baba is now a Senior Associate.""On behalf of Emergence, I am proud to announce Lotti and Yaz's promotions,"" said Emergence Capital Founder and General Partner Gordon Ritter. ""They each bring a unique perspective to the industry, have made significant contributions to the team, and exemplify Emergence's core values. We are thrilled to recognize them for their outstanding performances.""Lotti's promotion to Partner honors the value she brings to Emergence. She joined the firm in 2018 as a Senior Associate and was named Principal in 2020. Less than a year later, Lotti was promoted to Partner as a result of the extraordinary impact she has had on the firm, the team, and the companies Emergence backs. Lotti's strong investor acumen and long-term perspective are instrumental in uncovering compelling and unique investment opportunities, and in leading operational change. She has an outstanding ability to understand complex business structures and to apply that knowledge both in her diligence and at the board table. Today, Lotti serves on the boards of High Alpha and Whistic and is a board observer to Convex, Oyster, and Talent Hack. She recently led Talent Hack's Series A, marking the largest Series A fundraise for a software company with a Latina founder and CEO. Her investment in Whistic's Series A in 2020 was Emergence's first fully remote deal. Both investments are indicative of Lotti's goal to invest in founders building B2B companies from all backgrounds and geographies. Lotti's impact on the firm is echoed by the CEOs she supports. ""I am incredibly grateful to work with Lotti,"" said Talent Hack Founder and CEO Alexandra Bonetti. ""She is an extraordinary investor and now a very close friend. What makes her stand out is her natural ability to balance her astute analytical skills with empathy. Her partnership has already impacted and will continue to be instrumental in Talent Hack's success.""Born and raised in Italy, Lotti can relate to the challenges entrepreneurs from immigrant or minority backgrounds face when breaking into venture and raising capital. She has made it her mission to use her platform to support this community. At Emergence, she hosts frequent roundtable events and office hours to help under-represented founders succeed. Lotti also speaks at entrepreneur-focused events such as TechCrunch's Disrupt and Advancing Women in Tech (AWIT). Prior to Emergence, Lotti served as an operator and investor in financial technology at Advent International, Ribbit Capital, and NerdWallet. She graduated from Wharton with a BS in economics and received an MBA from Stanford. Lotti is currently completing the Kauffman Fellows Program.""Having strong conviction, building lasting relationships, and focusing on the long-term impact are distinguishing elements of Emergence's culture,"" said Lotti Siniscalco, Partner at Emergence Capital. ""As I move forward in my career as a VC, I am committed to upholding these values by building a strong community for entrepreneurs of all backgrounds to become the next generation of enterprise/B2B founders.""Yaz joined the firm in 2019 as an Associate. As a Palestinian-American in an extended entrepreneurial family, he brings a global perspective to his sourcing, diligence, and support for founders. Yaz balances his analytical sensibility and his astute recognition of emerging trends with his incredible thoughtfulness and innate capacity to help everyone around him. Currently, Yaz is a board observer at Maze.Yaz came from LinkedIn, where he worked in business operations and corporate development. He previously worked in financial planning and analysis at Microsoft. Yaz studied finance and strategy at the University of Michigan's Stephen M. Ross School of Business while maintaining his passion for boxing as a national champion.""To people on the outside, boxing and investing may seem like solo endeavors. As captain of Michigan's boxing team, I fought this misconception by nurturing a true team-first approach, knowing that a fighter can only be as strong as the people they train with and learn from,"" said Yaz El-Baba, Senior Associate at Emergence Capital. ""One of the reasons I was attracted to Emergence was that the firm was founded on this same principle. I feel incredibly fortunate to have joined a team that aligns with my values and spends the time coaching and mentoring me on my path as an investor.""Emergence continues to make it a practice to promote from within, an approach carefully crafted by hiring individuals who hold its values, and developing their skills through mentorship. From the first non-founding investor who joined Emergence in 2006 through the present, the firm has maintained a true apprenticeship model. Of the five General Partners leading Emergence today, four started their careers at the firm as a junior investment professional (and the other is the co-founder).""The firm was founded on the philosophy that recruiting and growing our partnership from within would result in not only a stronger culture, but also in the best performance,"" said Ritter. ""With this philosophy in mind, we have designed an intentional career development program that will enable us to improve and build the next generation of investors and leaders to steward the firm's success into the future.""Emergence's deep-rooted values extend to its approach to team building and career development.

""Our team delivered strong revenue and adjusted EBITDA ahead of guidance while increasing our investment in technology and sales to drive consistent double-digit growth going forward,"" said Jeff Arnold, co-founder, chairman, and CEO of Sharecare. ""All channels demonstrated strong underlying trends with Enterprise moving closer to our goal of nearly 10 million lives on the platform by year-end, Provider delivering strong record retrieval volumes, and Consumer adding a significant number of new brands to its roster at higher average revenue per program. The strength of our performance across all channels in the quarter and year-to-date supports the increase in the midpoint of our adjusted EBITDA guidance for the year as well as sets a strong foundation to deliver on our fiscal 2022 outlook."" Third Quarter 2021 Financial Results All comparisons, unless otherwise noted, are to the three months ended September 30, 2020. Revenue of $105.6 million compared to $80.2 million, an increase of $25.4 million, or 32% Net loss of $43.1 million compared to net loss of $6.4 million, an increase to net loss of $36.7 million. Net loss in the third quarter of 2021 included $11.1 million in non-cash stock compensation; $16.8 million in transaction related acquisition costs and other costs associated with our business combination with Falcon Capital Acquisition Corp; $12.1 million in amortization of deferred financing fees associated with the settlement of debt; and $2.3 million of other non-cash or non-operational costs. Excluding these costs, the Adjusted Net Loss was $0.8 million in the current quarter. Adjusted EBITDA of $7.9 million compared to $13.3 million, a decrease of $5.4 million which reflects increased investments in the current period for both technology and sales force expansion to support growth and a reversal of temporary cost reduction actions in the prior year, including furloughing employees as a direct and prudent reaction to COVID-19. Net loss per share of $0.13 compared to $0.03, a decrease of $0.10 which reflects the aforementioned items impacting net loss. Adjusted earnings per share of $0.00 compared to $0.01, a decrease of $0.01 which excludes the impact of non-cash and non-operational expenses. Third Quarter 2021 Operational HighlightsAdded new employer, government, provider, and life sciences clients to support fiscal 2022 growth objectives.

A webcast replay of the call will be available for on-demand listening at the same link and will remain available for approximately 90 days.Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresIn addition to our financial results determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we believe the non-GAAP measures Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income (Loss), and Adjusted Earnings (Loss) Per Share (""Adjusted EPS"") are useful in evaluating our operating performance. We use Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income (Loss), and Adjusted EPS to evaluate our ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures, when taken together with the corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our business, results of operations, or outlook. In particular, we believe that the use of these non-GAAP measures is helpful to our investors as these metrics are used by management in assessing the health of our business and our operating performance. However, non-GAAP financial information is presented for supplemental informational purposes only, has limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate similarly-titled non-GAAP measures differently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of our non-GAAP financial measures.The calculations and reconciliations of historic Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income (Loss), and Adjusted EPS to net income (loss), the most directly comparable financial measure stated in accordance with GAAP, are provided below and in the accompanying financial tables. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliations and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business. We have not reconciled Adjusted EBITDA guidance to net income (loss) because we do not provide guidance for net income (loss) or for items that we do not consider indicative of our on-going performance, including, but not limited to, the impact of significant non-recurring items, as certain of these items are out of our control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted. Accordingly, reconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA guidance to the corresponding U.S. GAAP measures are not available without unreasonable effort.Adjusted EBITDAWe calculate adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) adjusted to exclude (i) depreciation and amortization, (ii) interest income, (iii) interest expense, (iv) loss on extinguishment of debt, (v) other expense/(income) (non-operating), (vi) loss from equity method investment, (vii) income tax (benefit) expense, (viii) share-based compensation, (ix) severance, (x) warrants issued with revenue contracts, and (xi) transaction and closing costs. We do not view the items excluded as representative of our ongoing operations.Adjusted Net Income (Loss)We calculate Adjusted net income (loss) as net income (loss) attributable to Sharecare, Inc. adjusted to exclude (i) amortization of acquired intangibles, (ii) amortization of deferred financing fees, (iii) change in fair value of warrant liability and contingent consideration, (iv) loss from equity method investments, (v) share-based compensation, (vi) severance, (vii) warrants issued with revenue contracts, (viii) transaction and closing costs, and (ix) the related income tax adjustments. We do not view the items excluded as representative of our ongoing operations.Adjusted Earnings (Loss) Per ShareWe calculate Adjusted EPS as adjusted net income (loss), as defined above, divided by the number of weighted average common shares outstanding - basic and diluted.

Regulators, including the US's FinCEN, the UK's Financial Conduct Authority, and Singapore's Monetary Authority, now expect all companies providing crypto products to be fully compliant within the year. Germany's BaFin has expected Travel Rule compliance since the beginning of October 2021. Adding counterparty information to a blockchain transaction doesn't just benefit exchanges and their regulators; it also allows consumers to trust to whom they are sending funds. The FTC reports that Americans lost over $80 million in cryptocurrency scams between October 2020 and April 2021.Currently, it is impossible to transfer personally identifiable information through the blockchain and equally improbable to tell with a high level of certainty if an institution is on the other side of the transaction. Additionally, the speed with which regulations are being enforced is not on par with industry readiness. Notabene leverages decentralized identity protocols to create a Trust Framework that allows companies to become Travel Rule compliant today. Notabene's offering comprises a suite of protocol-agnostic tools, software, and comprehensive data that enables crypto companies to manage counterparty risk securely and exchange customer data with any counterparty in a privacy-preserving way.""At Jump, we believe crypto will be the defining technological innovation of our age and look to invest in companies that move the industry forward. Notabene is well-positioned to be a leader in enabling mainstream crypto adoption by ensuring regulatory compliance for crypto-native companies and financial institutions worldwide.

With the announced Series A financing, Beacon will further invest in building out its network of expert neurologists for database curation and AI-augmented safety assessment reporting.Beacon Biosignals' Series A financing totals $27M,More news about: Beacon Biosignals","Beacon Biosignals","BOSTON, Nov. 8, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Beacon Biosignals, a neurotechnology company applying artificial intelligence to EEG (electroencephalography) to unlock precision medicine for any condition affecting the brain, has announced an oversubscribed $27M Series A financing led by General Catalyst and with participation from Casdin Capital. Proceeds will be used to scale Beacon's computational biomarker discovery platform and address the massive unmet need for quantitative clinical trial endpoints, safety tools, and computational diagnostics for neurology, psychiatry, and sleep medicine.Founded in 2019 by MD/PhDs and engineers from Harvard and MIT, Beacon's launch was propelled by the vision of a computing platform designed to scale the interrogation of large brainwave datasets with unprecedented throughput and capability. Beacon Biosignals holds one of the world's largest clinical EEG databases and couples that data with proprietary machine learning algorithms to identify neurobiomarkers associated with patient sub-types, drug activity and therapeutic efficacy. EEG is standard of care in the clinical diagnosis and management of many neurologic diseases and sleep disorders, but features of clinical significance are often buried in hours of EEG data. Broader uptake of EEG technology has been further limited by labor-intensive workflows and variability in clinician expert interpretation. Beacon's machine learning teams develop high-performing, reliable algorithms that can replicate the adjudicated consensus interpretation of multiple trained epileptologists, as well as novel neurobiomarkers (e.g. quantitative epileptiform spike burden) that exceed human capabilities over many hours or days of recording. Beacon's platform provides an architectural foundation for robust, data-tailored neurobiomarker pipelines that carry new discoveries from development to targeted deployment into clinical trials and novel therapeutic areas.""Our current progress has demonstrated that EEG is incredibly information-rich physiologic output reflecting genetic substrate, accumulated exposures and acute neurophysiologic changes, beyond what is captured in MRI, fMRI, CSF analyses or genetic analyses. We have already identified novel electrophysiologic signatures functionally linked to primary cognitive endpoints in Alzheimer's disease. We're further encouraged by the applications of our platform toward heterogenous psychiatric diseases such as schizophrenia and major depressive disorder,"" said Jacob Donoghue MD, PhD, Co-Founder and CEO of Beacon. ""Beacon is dedicated to helping our biopharma partners accelerate novel therapeutics to reach patients with significant unmet need. We are excited to partner with General Catalyst and Casdin Capital to scale our platform to drive new insights for patient stratification, PK/PD, and efficacy endpoints."" The announced Series A financing will enable Beacon to pursue new partnerships with leading pharma and biotech companies, and build on existing partnerships with Novartis, Praxis Precision Medicines, Cyclerion Therapeutics, Idorsia and other undisclosed leading biopharma and operational partners. ""The breadth and variety of successes we've had working with our pharma partners demonstrates just how critical it is to quantifiably measure the effects novel therapeutics have on the brain,"" said Donoghue. ""Reliable and replicable quantitative endpoints help drive faster, better-powered trials."" Beacon's platform is engineered to adapt to any EEG data source and maximize the scientific impact of biopharma partners' highest-priority clinical trials. In smaller phase 1 trials, application of quantitative physiologic biomarkers enables precise characterization of dose-related therapeutic neuroactivity, provides mechanistic insights and identifies novel primary or supplementary endpoints. By identifying variance across patient subgroups, these capabilities further inform trial enrollment criteria or help identify target responder populations. Neurobiomarkers can also be used to detect evolving disease to identify patients who are candidates for early intervention. With the announced Series A financing, Beacon will further invest in building out its network of expert neurologists for database curation and AI-augmented safety assessment reporting. Beacon Biosignals' Series A financing totals $27M, led by General Catalyst with participation from Casdin Capital, existing seed investors and new angel investors including Andy Beck, CEO of PathAI. This capital brings Beacon Biosignals' total funding to date to $30 million. As part of the deal, Robin Washington will join Beacon Biosignals' board of directors. Robin was previously CFO at Gilead and currently holds board seats at Alphabet (the parent company of Google), Salesforce and Honeywell.""It is now common knowledge that machine learning technologies will impact all corners of healthcare, but Beacon Biosignals is uniquely positioned to rapidly translate scientific and technical advances into clinical benefit for patients. We're excited to partner with Beacon as they build the future of predictive brain health analytics,"" said Hemant Taneja, Managing Partner of General Catalyst. Robin Washington, Beacon's incoming board member, adds ""Beacon's team has an unparalleled depth of expertise across clinical medicine, neurotechnology, machine learning and engineering. The traction with current partners is a clear signal of the value that Beacon contributes to cutting-edge clinical development programs reaching millions of patients.""About Beacon BiosignalsBeacon's machine learning platform for EEG enables and accelerates new treatments that transform the lives of patients with neurological, psychiatric or sleep disorders. Through novel machine learning algorithms, large datasets, and advances in software engineering, Beacon Biosignals is changing the way patients are treated for disorders of the brain.

Using data-centric AI technology, the application of AI will no longer depend on big data but on the data the entities actually have, which is often limited. ""You don't always need big data to win with AI. You need good data that teaches the AI what you want it to learn,"" said Ng, Founder & CEO of Landing AI. ""AI built for 50 million data points doesn't work when you only have 50 data points. By bringing machine learning to everyone regardless of the size of their data set, the next era of AI will have a real-world impact on all industries."" The data-centric approach of Landing AI is also key to making LandingLens fast and easy-to-use. The process of engineering the data, instead of the AI software, gives an efficient way for manufacturers to teach an AI model what to do. Domain experts, not just AI experts, can now build an AI system, and take it to production. For example, rather than needing to write pages of code to train a neural network, a domain expert can do it with a few mouse clicks. This no code/low code data-centric platform enables new users to build advanced AI models in less than a day. Vision inspection projects that used to take over a year can be executed in just weeks using LandingLens. ""Landing AI will unleash the power of the Industrial IoT one company, one factory, and one manufacturing line at a time,"" said Scott MacDonald, Co-Founder and Managing Partner of McRock Capital. ""We partner with relentless entrepreneurs, like Andrew, who bring transformative digital technologies to large industrial markets."" As part of the financing, MacDonald has joined the Landing AI Board of Directors. ""Digital modernization of manufacturing is rapidly growing and is expected to reach $300 billion by 2023,"" said George Mathew, Managing Director at Insight Partners. ""The opportunity and need for Landing AI is only exploding. It will unlock the untapped segment of targeted machine vision projects addressing quality, efficiency and output. We're looking forward to playing a role in the next phase of Landing AI's exciting journey."" Landing AI is on a strong growth trajectory and customers are reaping the benefits. ""Partnering with Landing AI can improve the reliability and efficiency of our quality inspection process, which is important to our company's growth. Using cutting-edge deep learning tools like LandingLens enables our team to move faster and focus on developing and commercializing our next-generation batteries,"" said Tim Holme, Co-founder & CTO, QuantumScape. The new investment will be used to accelerate product innovation as well as grow engineering and operations teams within Landing AI, including engineering, product, sales, and marketing.

The participating companies' joint White Paper, ""Total Carbon Accounting: A Framework to Deliver Localized Carbon Intensity Data,"" explores advanced analytic methods designed to better compute the carbon intensity of grid electricity with higher degrees of geographic and temporal granularity, ensuring the energy sector is best equipped to evaluate, prioritize, and measure decarbonization activities in the future. ""Capable of closely identifying where and when generated power is consumed, the 'Total Carbon Accounting' approach detailed in our research provides a unique basis for assessing all carbon emissions associated with electricity flowing throughout homes and businesses,"" said Aram Shumavon, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Kevala. ""Our innovative framework for carbon accounting will fundamentally redefine how governments, regulators, corporations, and individuals invest in and achieve emissions reductions across the grid. We are delighted to share the work of our consortium on this important topic."" Dr. Bob Currie, Vice President of Products and Strategy at Kevala, said, ""Kevala exists to accelerate decarbonization, to do this we need to innovate and collaborate. Our platform and products are focused on expanding the granular understanding of locational and temporal variations in energy, making more accurate and specific carbon intensity data a natural next step.""The Total Carbon Accounting (TCA) method requires complex, simultaneous analyses of both (1) the physical flows of power across all individual nodes on the grid within a given point in time, and (2) the carbon associated with all generation sources – including those embedded in the distribution system and customer premises – as well as the larger transmission-connected units that participate in the market. In leveraging TCA's comprehensive methodology, key energy stakeholders can more accurately drive the matching of carbon-free power supplies to load forecasts.""By utilizing extraordinarily granular datasets and new tools to trace power generation throughout the grid, industry reporting around emission reduction efforts will improve exponentially,"" said Duncan Burt, Chief Sustainability Officer of National Grid, ""this data will create new insights that will help our communities understand the energy they use and ensure we can properly measure how we are achieving the goal of a lower carbon grid.""Current methods for carbon accounting utilize gross averaging across wide geographical areas and timeframes, thereby overlooking the temporal aspect of clean power generation, as well as the effects of closely connected renewable generation at the distribution level. By focusing on discrete analyses of all components in the balance of power supply and consumption constraints on the grid, TCA serves as a long-term foundation for enhancing carbon awareness in the United States and around the world. TCA is now being tested in pilot deployments by major utilities in both North America and Europe.""With revolutionary advances in grid analytics, this approach changes the paradigm in terms of how carbon removal can be measured and understood for delivered power,"" said Sunny Elebua, Vice President of Strategy and Chief Sustainability Officer at Exelon. ""We are excited to pilot this new capability and understand the opportunities it can create for energy generators and consumers, grid operators, and local communities along the path to power sector decarbonization.""Kevala's partnership with National Grid and Exelon Corporation on this White Paper and technology further demonstrates the growth and momentum of the company's Assessor platform, signaling an increasing drive for improved data assessment around the 'electrification of everything.' The TCA White Paper release follows several recent, high-profile corporate announcements from Kevala, including the closing of its $21 million Series A funding round and the expansion of its Advisory and Professional Services department.To view Kevala, National Grid, and Exelon Corporation's ""Total Carbon Accounting: A Framework to Deliver Localized Carbon Intensity Data"" White Paper, click here.About Kevala Inc.: Kevala's mission is to provide an objective understanding of the production, delivery, and consumption of energy in support of the radical decarbonization of the global economy.

This investment follows several years of clinical research and development, including 10 human clinical trials that further validate io's technology as being able to improve health outcomes through superior protein absorption by the body. This financing will help io drive awareness around the importance of protein absorption and bring its technology and products to consumers at scale. Brian Loeb of Continental Grain will be taking a board seat at io. SOSV is also an additional investor in this round, with William Hood & Company serving as an advisor to the round. The current global wellness market is estimated at $1.5 trillion and, while a focus on nutrition has always existed in the wellness sector, consumers are increasingly demanding that their food not only taste good but also help them to accomplish their wellness goals. Beyond that, the COVID-19 pandemic illuminated and propagated the systemic link between food, health, and wellness, driving consumers to closely research the quality of products they're ingesting. Due to these external factors, structural changes have been occurring within the protein space, but a gap still exists in true innovations surrounding protein quality and absorption, with many protein sources falling short of the nutritional value that consumers are led to believe they contain. In the increasingly crowded wellness space, io's technology is uniquely positioned to deliver optimal nutrition and maximum physical results while providing a great taste.""As consumers become more educated about their nutrition, marketing gimmicks will simply no longer be a viable option for brands and retailers. Where others fall flat, io is primed to deliver an optimized protein product that bodies can process and use more effectively,"" said Chris Flynn Rozanski, Co-founder and CEO of Ingredient Optimized. ""We're committed to building a better, healthier future and, with the support of Continental Grain, our focus now is to tell our story and support our brand partners who are committed to real, science-backed innovation in nutrition.""At its most basic, the human body is an advanced processing machine that requires premium ingredients to function at an optimal level. Even high quality protein supplements – like whey isolate – suffer from a significant lack of absorption in the body due to its complex structure, leading to wasted dollars and lost effort. io's patent pending process optimizes its structure by using focused energy to alter the protein's conformation and structure. In a revolutionary way, the io process makes it more soluble and digestible, yielding 123% increased bioavailability and a 46% reduction in stomach discomfort, allowing bodies to use the protein more efficiently. ""Our investments focus heavily on cutting edge food technology such as, Impossible, Memphis Meats, and Modern Meadow,"" said Brian Loeb, Co-Head, Conti Ventures at Continental Grain. ""Ingredient Optimized's devotion to bringing scientific and clinically-backed technological solutions to its platform made it a natural fit for our expanding portfolio. The tech platform's potential to disrupt numerous categories – from sports nutrition and food and beverage to clinical nutrition and animal feed – is palpable and we're excited to see what they do next.""io is a technologically improved protein ingredient, made without hydrolysis, creating higher quality ingredients and better-tasting protein. The alternative process of hydrolysis is long used but still a relatively unproven method, falling far short of what consumers expect. Additionally, the by-product of the hydrolysis process results in an acidic taste, often leading to added artificial sweeteners or sugar substitutes which have been linked to negative health results. More than 20 products featuring io's ingredients – including powders, drinks, and snacks – are currently available nationwide in retailers including Amazon, Walmart, GNC, The Vitamin Shoppe, and more. About Ingredient Optimized:Ingredient Optimized is a biotechnology company focused on improving the quality of protein and overall nutrition through their Ingredient Optimized technology. When their io isolate is a component ingredient, protein products are able to deliver superior protein absorption by the body, reduced stomach discomfort, and improved taste. Backed by scientific research and clinical trials, the io technology is able to improve health outcomes for the protein-deficient elderly and bodybuilders alike.

(Nasdaq: APPS) announced financial results for the fiscal second quarter ended September 30, 2021. The Company completed the acquisitions of AdColony Holdings AS and Fyber N.V. on April 29 and May 25, 2021, respectively. Specific references made to ""pro forma"" results in this release provide investors with quarterly results and comparisons as if all acquired businesses were owned for the entirety of the second quarter of fiscal 2021. The Company believes that pro forma results, where applicable, can provide investors with more relevant year-over-year comparisons. The reconciliations between the pro forma and GAAP financial results for the relevant periods are provided in the tables following the Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows below.Recent Financial Highlights:Fiscal second quarter of 2022 revenue totaled $310.2 million, representing a 338% increase year-over-year on an as-reported basis and a 63% increase year-over-year as compared to the comparable pro forma figure for the fiscal second quarter of 2021. GAAP net loss for the fiscal second quarter of 2022, inclusive of a $22.1 million fair value adjustment to the contingent acquisition-related earn-outs, was $5.9 million, or ($0.06) per share, as compared to GAAP net income of $0.4 million, or $0.00 per share for the fiscal second quarter of 2021. Non-GAAP adjusted net income1 for the fiscal second quarter of 2022 was $45.3 million, or $0.44 per share, as compared to Non-GAAP adjusted net income of $14.5 million, or $0.15 per share, in the fiscal second quarter of 2021. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA2 for the fiscal second quarter of 2022 was $47.9 million, representing growth of 191% as compared to Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA of $16.5 million in the fiscal second quarter of 2021.""I am pleased that we delivered record financial results in the second quarter, but even more pleased with how we have strategically laid the foundation to capture a dramatically expanded market opportunity set in future quarters and years,"" said Bill Stone, CEO. ""Our first full quarter reporting as a consolidated entity provided early evidence of the financial benefits from our greater scope and scale. Meanwhile, we are now strategically positioning the Company for continued success in the future with a fully differentiated end-to-end platform. The integration is proceeding ahead of our own initial expectations and has been very well-received by partners and customers across the full spectrum of the platform. Revenue synergies are already materializing ahead of our expectations, even though we are merely at the onset of exploiting our platform's inherent competitive advantages. Execution continues to be our primary focus, as we confidently aspire to realize far greater, more strategic synergies in future quarters.""Mr. Stone concluded, ""With respect to our financial performance during the September quarter, we continued to witness strong demand from app publishers and advertisers for our unique set of product offerings across the full range of the platform. Our On-Device Media revenue and our In-App Media revenue each increased more than 60% year-over-year on a pro forma basis. Within the On-Device Media segment, our primary health metric, revenue-per-device (""RPD""), increased more than 50% year-over-year on devices in the U.S., and more than 100% on devices outside of the U.S. during what was an all-time record quarter for the total number of new devices activated globally with our software installed. Scale efficiencies and disciplined expense controls once again enabled us to translate this top-line growth into non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP EPS growth of more than 190% on a year-over-year basis. We expect to continue to demonstrate incremental profitable operating leverage, particularly as we realize considerable additional acquisition-related synergies. In summary, I am more upbeat than ever about the Company's future, as I believe that our 'One DT' platform is ideally positioned to not only adapt to, but will in fact fully benefit from, several key developing trends within our industry, such as the diversification of ad spend into other fully calculable performance-driven options, legislative and regulatory actions designed to foster alternative market opportunities, and the recent wave of ad-tech consolidation which has reduced the number of independent competitors, thereby further differentiating the uniqueness of our strategic market approach.""Fiscal 2022 Second Quarter Financial ResultsTotal revenue for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 was $310.2 million. Total ""On-Device Media"" revenue, which represents revenue derived from the Company's Application Media and Content Media platform products, increased 73% year-over-year to $129.4 million. Before intercompany eliminations, total ""In-App Media"" revenue, which represents revenue derived from the Fyber and AdColony businesses, increased 61% year-over-year on a pro forma basis to $187.2 million. Fyber contributed $125.7 million during the quarter, while AdColony contributed $61.5 million during the quarter.GAAP net loss for the fiscal second quarter of 2022, inclusive of a $22.1 million fair value adjustment to the contingent acquisition-related earn-outs, was $5.9 million, or ($0.06) per share, as compared to GAAP net income from continuing operations of $0.4 million, or $0.00 per share for the second quarter of fiscal 2021. Non-GAAP adjusted net income1 for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 was $45.3 million, or $0.44 per share, as compared to Non-GAAP adjusted net income of $14.5 million, or $0.15 per share, in the second quarter of fiscal 2021.Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA2 for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 was $47.9 million as compared to Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA of $16.5 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2021. The reconciliations between GAAP and Non-GAAP financial results for all referenced periods are provided in the tables immediately following the Unaudited Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows below.Business OutlookBased on information available as of November 2, 2021, the Company currently expects the following for the third quarter of fiscal 2022:Revenue of between $350 million and $355 million Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA2 of between $53 million and $56 million Non-GAAP adjusted EPS1 of between $0.41 and $0.44, based on approximately 105 million diluted shares outstanding and an effective tax rate of between 15% and 20% on non-GAAP net incomeIt is not reasonably practicable to provide a business outlook for GAAP net income because the Company cannot reasonably estimate the changes in stock-based compensation expense, which is directly impacted by changes in the Company's stock price, any adjustment to the contingent earn-out provisions, which will continue to be adjusted to fair value through the end of the earn-out periods, or other items that are difficult to predict with precision.About Digital Turbine, Inc.Digital Turbine is the leading independent mobile growth platform and levels up the landscape for advertisers, publishers, carriers and OEMS.

These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP adjusted net income and earnings per share (""EPS"") and non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA. Reconciliations to the nearest GAAP measures of all non-GAAP measures included in this press release can be found in the tables below.Non-GAAP measures are provided to enhance investors' overall understanding of the Company's current financial performance, prospects for the future and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. The Company believes that these non-GAAP measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding financial performance by excluding certain expenses and benefits that may not be indicative of recurring core business operating results. The Company believes the non-GAAP measures that exclude such items when viewed in conjunction with GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliations enhance the comparability of results against prior periods and allow for greater transparency of financial results. The Company believes non-GAAP measures facilitate management's internal comparison of its financial performance to that of prior periods as well as trend analysis for budgeting and planning purposes. The presentation of non-GAAP measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.1Non-GAAP adjusted net income and EPS are defined as GAAP net income and EPS adjusted to exclude the effect of stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles, adjustments in the fair value of earn-out liabilities associated with acquisitions, and transaction-related expenses and compensation costs. Readers are cautioned that non-GAAP adjusted net income and EPS should not be construed as an alternative to comparable GAAP net income figures determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP as an indicator of profitability or performance, which is the most comparable measure under GAAP.2Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA is calculated as GAAP net income excluding the following cash and non-cash expenses: net interest income/(expense), adjustments in the fair value of earn-out liabilities associated with acquisitions, income tax provision, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangibles, foreign exchange transactions, and transaction-related expenses and compensation costs. Readers are cautioned that non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP as an indicator of performance, which is the most comparable measure under GAAP.Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP adjusted net income and EPS are used by management as internal measures of profitability and performance. They have been included because the Company believes that the measures are used by certain investors to assess the Company's financial performance before non-cash charges and certain costs that the Company does not believe are reflective of its underlying business.Forward-Looking StatementsThis news release includes ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

Venture capital firms HetzMore news about: Velocity","Velocity","TEL AVIV, Israel, Nov. 2, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Velocity, the Tel Aviv-based startup that accelerates the way developers build and deliver products, today announced that it has raised a $17 million Series A round led by New York-based venture capital and private equity firm Insight Partners. Venture capital firms Hetz Ventures and Greycroft participated in the round alongside leading angel investors and advisors, including Danny Grander (Co-Founder, Snyk), Nadir Izrael (Co-Founder & CTO, Armis), Yevgeny Dibrov (Co-Founder & CEO, Armis), Dan Fougere (ex-CRO, DataDog), Prashanth Chandrasekar (CEO, Stackoverflow), Elik Eizenberg (CTO & Co-Founder, BigPanda), Abhinav Asthana (CEO & Co-Founder, Postman), and Ben Bernstein (Co-Founder & ex-CEO, Twistlock). The investment, which brings the company's total funding to $22 million, will enable Velocity to expand its team and allow developers to streamline and expedite product development with the ability to create on-demand, fully isolated production-like environments in the same easy way they create new Git branches. Velocity recently came out of stealth mode into beta and is already working with various customers including StreamElements and Granulate. ""More than 20% of a developer's time is being wasted on creating and maintaining non-production environments, instead of working on delivering new features to customers,"" says Velocity CEO and co-founder Tal Kain. ""This comes with high maintenance costs and delays in deploying new features to production. Our goal at Velocity is to deliver a production-like environment in a click so that developers only have to put in minimal effort and upkeep on their side to operate in their regular workflow.""Lonne Jaffe, Managing Director at Insight Partners, is joining Velocity's board of directors. ""Developers care about being productive and independent, and companies want to deliver quality products,"" says Jaffe. ""With Velocity's innovative, cutting-edge solution for spinning up production-like environments quickly, everyone wins. We at Insight are thrilled to welcome Velocity to our portfolio and look forward to joining the fantastic team on the company's ScaleUp journey."" With the rise of microservices and cloud-native applications, environments are becoming more complex to manage and maintain, especially for developers who want to replicate real use cases in an environment similar to production to avoid errors and outages that can cost a company millions of dollars. Efforts to ensure that these environments are really aligned with the production reality place a huge burden on developers. Kain and CTO & co-founder, Kobi Meirson, are fully aware of this burden, having experienced the problem themselves in previous roles. Add to that, the pain of needing to compete to get access to a specific resource or wasting time waiting to deploy to a shared, staging environment.""We met multiple companies that started investing months of their DevOps time building their own home-grown solutions, just to be able to work and debug easily,"" says Kain. ""It becomes even more difficult to do this when you don't have the ability to replicate all the external dependencies, such as cloud resources, with the data and the right context that the developer needs to work with.""Instead of being a new tool that must be learned, Velocity works with developers' current toolbox and existing workspace, integrating with their IDE of choice to remove any friction to their daily workflow. The solution is tech and cloud-agnostic and easy to maintain as any developer can spin up and create ephemeral environments on-demand, with a simple command without waiting for DevOps to create it for them. With Velocity's automatic synchronization, every change or new service added to production is synced in real-time to the developers' isolated environments. As a result, DevOps teams also benefit from getting time back in their day that they would normally put toward maintaining both production and pre-production environments. Velocity can also help save cloud costs and resources by only running environments and resources when needed. Developers can manually destroy their environments or admins can enable time-to-live capabilities to shut down idle environments to avoid running 24/7.""With Velocity, you don't need to invest time spinning up an environment, and you are not dependent on other developers,"" says Shir Maor, FullStack Developer at Granulate, one of Velocity's early adopters and customers. Saving time and developer productivity is only one of Velocity's benefits, in addition to easier collaboration with remote teams and stakeholders. Each isolated environment gets its own URL, which can be shared with other teams for instant feedback. Nils Vollenbruch, who works on the DevOps team at StreamElements, has also freed up his time to focus on business-critical needs instead. ""In the future, every developer, no matter from what team, could use Velocity as their standard development flow, where they just pick one service that they want to work on and run all the other services and databases.""Founded in late 2020, Velocity is racing ahead of its product roadmap, onboarding customers and hiring rapidly.

Investment and partnershipSWS will use the investment to drive the development and commercialisation of its wet chemical water sensor platform to help customers make smarter water and wastewater monitoring decisions. The company's vision is to become a key enabler for the digitisation of the water industry, to help protect this precious resource and improve sustainability.Partnership synergies will be explored through working on integrated product and service offerings with other SKion Water portfolio companies, as well as leveraging the SKion Water brand for sales of SWS's own sensor products.Platform extension SWS is a late research stage company that has already launched and generated sales with its first product, a sensor probe for continuous monitoring of nitrite and nitrate levels in water. The Series A investment now supports an extension of the DropletSens™ platform to cover additional measurement capabilities and formats, including modules for dry installation sensor cabinets. The initial target segment for the sensor probe is environmental monitoring of surface water to monitor long-term changes or in case of catchment areas, act as an early warning system to flag up discharge events. Effluent monitoring for municipal and industrial wastewater treatment will be a primary target for the drybox sensor format. Here continuous monitoring enables early warning of increased discharge levels, triggering early remedial action to avoid potential discharge penalties.Ultimately, the autonomously generated near real-time, high-frequency, lab-quality sensor data should become a key enabler for closed loop process control and digitisation of a wide range of water treatment processes, aimed at optimised chemicals dosing and energy savings.Shared vision and primed for growth'We are absolutely delighted to welcome SKion Water on board, a highly respected investor with a shared vision of the pivotal role that advanced sensing solutions will play in improved water management and digitisation of this key industry.

These non-GAAP financial measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, net income as a measure of financial performance or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP, and should not be construed as an inference that the Company's future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures should be read in conjunction with the Company's financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. The reconciliations of the Company's non-GAAP financial measures to the corresponding GAAP measures should be carefully evaluated. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) before interest expense, net, provision for (benefit from) income taxes and depreciation and amortization, excluding the impact of share-based compensation expense, gain (loss) on sale-leaseback transactions, capital transaction costs, legal settlements, asset impairment and other items that are not indicative of the Company's ongoing operations, including incremental costs related to COVID-19. Free cash flow before growth capital expenditures is defined as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less center maintenance capital expenditures and corporate capital expenditures. The Company presents these non-GAAP financial measures because management believes that these measures assist investors and analysts in comparing the Company's operating performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that management does not believe are indicative of the Company's ongoing operating performance. Investors are encouraged to evaluate these adjustments and the reasons the Company considers them appropriate for supplemental analysis. In evaluating the non-GAAP financial measures, investors should be aware that, in the future, the Company may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in the Company's presentation of its non-GAAP financial measures. There can be no assurance that the Company will not modify the presentation of non-GAAP financial measures in future periods, and any such modification may be material. In addition, the Company's non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies in the Company's industry or across different industries.The non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, and investors should not consider these measures in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of the Company's results as reported under GAAP. Please note that the Company has not reconciled the Adjusted EBITDA forward-looking guidance included in this press release to the most directly comparable GAAP measure because this cannot be done without unreasonable effort due to the variability and low visibility with respect to the Company's effective tax rate, financings, and employee stock compensation programs, which are potential adjustments to future earnings. We expect the variability of these items to have a potentially unpredictable, and a potentially significant, impact on our future GAAP financial results.Forward-Looking StatementsThis press release includes ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of federal securities regulations. Forward-looking statements in this press release include, but are not limited to, the Company's plans, strategies and prospects, both business and financial, including its financial outlook for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2021 and expected number of new center openings.

In addition, any statements or information that refer to expectations, beliefs, plans, projections, objectives, performance or other characterizations of future events or circumstances, including any underlying assumptions, are forward-looking.

In June 2020, we closed on an approximate $101.5 million secured loan from an investor group comprised solely of our stockholders or their affiliates. The secured loan carried an interest rate of 12.0% and was scheduled to mature in June 2021. In January 2021, we extinguished the secured loan plus accrued interest with a book value of $108.6 million by converting the loan into 5,429,570 shares of our Series A Preferred Stock, which had a fair value of $149.6 million, as determined by an independent third-party valuation, at the time of conversion. Accordingly, we booked a $41.0 million loss upon conversion. (b) Represents the incremental net (credits) expenses we recognized related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The net credits we recognized during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 consist primarily of the recovery of certain qualifying expenses recovered under the CARES Act, partially offset by COVID-19 legal-related costs. For the three months ended September 30, 2020, COVID-19 related expenses consisted of $9.5 million for project cost write-offs for sites no longer deemed viable as a result of the economic downturn caused by COVID-19, $5.5 million for the employee portion of health care coverage which is normally paid by employees but was paid by us during this period on behalf of our employees, and $2.0 million of emergency leave and non-working payroll, which includes subsequent recovery of certain expenses under the CARES Act, severance and charitable contributions made to support our employees who were directly impacted by COVID-19. For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, COVID-19 related expenses consisted of $14.6 million for project cost write-offs for sites no longer deemed viable as a result of the economic downturn caused by COVID-19, $12.0 million for the employee portion of health care coverage which is normally paid by employees but was paid by us during this period on behalf of our employees, and $22.7 million of emergency leave and non-working payroll, which includes subsequent recovery of certain expenses under the CARES Act, severance and charitable contributions made to support our employees who were directly impacted by COVID-19. (c) We adjust for the impact of gains or losses on the sale-leaseback of our properties as they do not reflect costs associated with our ongoing operations. (d) Represents one-time costs related to capital transactions, including debt and equity offerings that are non-recurring in nature.

These are non-recurring in nature and do not reflect costs associated with our normal ongoing operations. (f) Includes costs associated with large corporate restructuring charges, executive level involuntary terminations and other transactions which are unusual and non-recurring in nature. For the nine months ended September 30, 2021, other expenses consisted of $1.6 million of incremental expenses related to a winter storm resulting in historical freezing temperatures affecting our Texas region, and $0.8 million of executive level severance.

(NYSE:PBF) today reported third quarter 2021 income from operations of $100.9 million as compared to loss from operations of $342.7 million for the third quarter of 2020. Excluding special items, third quarter 2021 income from operations was $101.0 million as compared to a loss from operations of $374.2 million for the third quarter of 2020. PBF Energy's financial results reflect the consolidation of PBF Logistics LP (NYSE: PBFX), a master limited partnership of which PBF Energy indirectly owns the general partner and approximately 48% of the limited partner interests as of quarter-end.The company reported third quarter 2021 net income of $78.7 million and net income attributable to PBF Energy Inc. of $59.1 million or $0.49 per share. This compares to net loss of $397.8 million, and net loss attributable to PBF Energy Inc. of $417.2 million or $(3.49) per share for the third quarter 2020. Non-cash special items included in the third quarter 2021 results, which increased net income by a net, after-tax benefit of $45.6 million, or $0.37 per share, consisted of a gain on extinguishment of debt related to the repurchase of a portion of the outstanding unsecured notes, a net tax benefit on remeasurement of deferred tax assets, and change in fair value of the contingent consideration associated with earn-out provisions related to both the Martinez Acquisition and PBFX CPI Operations LLC acquisition. Adjusted fully-converted net income for the third quarter 2021, excluding special items, was $14.0 million, or $0.12 per share on a fully-exchanged, fully-diluted basis, as described below, compared to adjusted fully-converted net loss of $346.6 million or $(2.87) per share, for the third quarter 2020. Tom Nimbley, PBF Energy's Chairman and CEO, said, ""PBF's third quarter results reflect both the improving demand environment, as well as the continuing challenges facing our industry. During the quarter we successfully executed a significant turnaround at Torrance, conducted unplanned maintenance at Toledo and managed to navigate the turmoil delivered by Hurricane Ida on the Gulf Coast. Our Chalmette refining team safely brought the refinery down in advance of the storm. As a result, we experienced very little damage and were able to quickly resume operations after restoring power to the plant. We are very proud of the way our Chalmette team performed, even as many employees were dealing with their own storm-related hardships."" Mr. Nimbley remarked, ""Demand has continued its gradual improvement and is at or above pre-pandemic levels for certain products. With improving demand and the call for more energy globally, we expect incremental crude supply to enter the market and support wider differentials. Despite the improving fundamental backdrop, we continue to be battered by the persistent waffling of the Environmental Protection Agency and never-ending delays in addressing the broken RFS program. These delays are causing economic harm to independent refiners, jeopardizing jobs, creating uncertainty in the market and are penalizing consumers at the pump by supporting high gasoline prices."" Mr. Nimbley concluded, ""Despite these recent challenges, we are confident that we have the operations, team and resources to overcome the current hurdles. We exited the third quarter with reduced debt and ample liquidity, including approximately $1.5 billion in cash, that we believe will support our business as market conditions improve.""Liquidity and Financial PositionAs of September 30, 2021, our operational liquidity was more than $2.6 billion based on approximately $1.4 billion of cash and in excess of $1.2 billion of borrowing availability under our asset-based lending facility. In addition, PBF Logistics LP liquidity included $28.6 million in cash and approximately $371.0 million of availability under its revolving credit facility.In the second half of the year, the company repurchased a combined total principal amount of approximately $229.0 million of its 2028 6.00% Senior Notes and 2025 7.25% Senior Notes for an aggregate cash amount of approximately $146.8 million. Combined with the $75.0 million of debt repayments made by PBF Logistics LP, consolidated debt for PBF has been reduced by approximately $304.0 million.Strategic Update and OutlookIn addition to focusing on the safety and reliability of our core refining operations, we continue to progress the previously announced potential project for a renewable fuels production facility intended to be co-located at the Chalmette refinery. The project is expected to use certain idled assets, including an idle hydrocracker, along with a newly-constructed pre-treatment unit to establish a 20,000 barrel per day renewable diesel production facility. On August 5, 2021, it was announced that PBF selected Honeywell UOP single-stage EcofiningTM technology for use in the potential project. We are currently in advanced discussions with additional potential strategic and financial partners.Consistent with our previous guidance, and the improving market outlook, our full-year capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $400 to $450 million. Should market conditions change from our current expectations, we expect that we will review our capital requirements and adjust as needed. With demand for our products continuing to gradually improve, we expect to remain responsive to market conditions and for the fourth quarter, we expect total throughput regionally as follows: East Coast to average 250,000 to 270,000 barrels per day (""bpd""); Mid-Continent to average 150,000 to 160,000 bpd; Gulf Coast to average 170,000 to 180,000 bpd; and West Coast to average 310,000 to 330,000 bpd. The throughput figures are reflective of planned work expected to take place during the quarter at our Martinez and East Coast facilities.Adjusted Fully-Converted ResultsAdjusted fully-converted results assume the exchange of all PBF Energy Company LLC Series A Units and dilutive securities into shares of PBF Energy Inc. Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis, resulting in the elimination of the noncontrolling interest and a corresponding adjustment to the company's tax provision.

AND SUBSIDIARIES EARNINGS RELEASE TABLES FOOTNOTES TO EARNINGS RELEASE TABLES (1) Adjusted fully-converted information is presented in this table as management believes that these Non-GAAP measures, when presented in conjunction with comparable GAAP measures, are useful to investors to compare our results across the periods presented and facilitates an understanding of our operating results. We also use these measures to evaluate our operating performance. These measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The differences between adjusted fully-converted and GAAP results are explained in footnotes 2 through 6. (2) Represents the elimination of the noncontrolling interest associated with the ownership by the members of PBF Energy Company LLC (""PBF LLC"") other than PBF Energy Inc., as if such members had fully exchanged their PBF LLC Series A Units for shares of PBF Energy's Class A common stock. (3) Represents an adjustment to reflect PBF Energy's estimated annualized statutory corporate tax rate of approximately 26.6% and 26.3% for the 2021 and 2020 periods, respectively, applied to net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interest for all periods presented. The adjustment assumes the full exchange of existing PBF LLC Series A Units as described in footnote 2. (4) The Non-GAAP measures presented include adjusted fully-converted net income (loss) excluding special items, income (loss) from operations excluding special items, EBITDA excluding special items and gross refining margin excluding special items. Special items for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020 relate to LCM inventory adjustments, change in fair value of contingent consideration, gain on sale of hydrogen plants, impairment expense, severance costs related to reduction in workforce, (gain) loss on extinguishment of debt, changes in the Tax Receivable Agreement liability, and net tax (benefit) expense on the remeasurement of deferred tax assets, all as discussed further below. Additionally, the cumulative effects of all current and prior period special items on equity are shown in footnote 13. Although we believe that Non-GAAP financial measures excluding the impact of special items provide useful supplemental information to investors regarding the results and performance of our business and allow for useful period-over-period comparisons, such Non-GAAP measures should only be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Special Items: LCM inventory adjustment - LCM is a GAAP requirement related to inventory valuation that mandates inventory to be stated at the lower of cost or market. Our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined using the last-in, first-out (""LIFO"") inventory valuation methodology, in which the most recently incurred costs are charged to cost of sales and inventories are valued at base layer acquisition costs. Market is determined based on an assessment of the current estimated replacement cost and net realizable selling price of the inventory. In periods where the market price of our inventory declines substantially, cost values of inventory may exceed market values. In such instances, we record an adjustment to write down the value of inventory to market value in accordance with GAAP. In subsequent periods, the value of inventory is reassessed and an LCM inventory adjustment is recorded to reflect the net change in the LCM inventory reserve between the prior period and the current period. The following table includes the LCM inventory reserve as of each date presented (in millions): 2021 2020 January 1, $ 669.6 $ 401.6 June 30, — 1,103.0 September 30, — 1,093.1 The following table includes the corresponding impact of changes in the LCM inventory reserve on income (loss) from operations and net income (loss) for the periods presented (in millions): Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2021 2020 2021 2020 Net LCM inventory adjustment benefit (charge) in income (loss) from operations $ — $ 9.9 $ 669.6 $ (691.5) Net LCM inventory adjustment benefit (charge) in net income (loss) — 7.3 491.5 (509.6) Change in Fair Value of Contingent Consideration - During the three months ended September 30, 2021, we recorded a change in fair value of the contingent consideration related to the Martinez Contingent Consideration and the PBFX Contingent Consideration which decreased income from operations and net income by $0.1 million and $0.1 million, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2021, we recorded a change in fair value of the contingent consideration primarily related to the Martinez Contingent Consideration which decreased income from operations and net income by $26.2 million and $19.2 million, respectively. During the three months ended September 30, 2020, we recorded a change in the fair value of the contingent consideration related to the Martinez Contingent Consideration and the PBFX Contingent Consideration which increased income from operations and net income by $28.6 million and $21.1 million, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2020, we recorded a change in the fair value of the contingent consideration primarily related to the Martinez Contingent Consideration which increased income from operations and net income by $93.5 million and $68.9 million, respectively. Gain on Sale of Hydrogen Plants - During the nine months ended September 30, 2020, we recorded a gain on the sale of five hydrogen plants. The gain increased income from operations and net income by $471.1 million and $347.2 million, respectively. There was no such gain during the three or nine months ended September 30, 2021. Impairment expense - During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, we recorded an impairment charge which decreased income from operations and net income by $7.0 million and $5.2 million, respectively, resulting from the write-down of certain PBFX long-lived assets. There were no such charges during the three or nine months ended September 30, 2021. Severance Costs - During the nine months ended September 30, 2020, we recorded a severance charge related to a reduction in our workforce that decreased income from operations and net income by $12.9 million and $9.5 million, respectively. There were no such costs in any of the other periods presented. (Gain) Loss on Extinguishment of debt - During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, we recorded a pre-tax gain on extinguishment of debt related to the repurchase of a portion of the 6.00% senior unsecured notes due 2028 and the 7.25% senior unsecured notes due 2025, which increased income before income taxes and net income by $60.3 million and $44.3 million, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2020, we recorded pre-tax debt extinguishment costs related to the redemption of the 2023 Senior Notes which decreased income before income taxes and net income by $22.2 million and $16.4 million, respectively. Change in Tax Receivable Agreement liability - During the three months ended September 30, 2020, we recorded a change in the Tax Receivable Agreement liability that increased income before income taxes and net income by $252.2 million and $185.9 million, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2020, we recorded a change in the Tax Receivable Agreement liability that increased income before income taxes and net income by $240.6 million and $177.3 million, respectively. There was no change to the Tax Receivable Agreement liability during the three or nine months ended September 30, 2021. The changes in the Tax Receivable Agreement liability reflect charges or benefits attributable to changes in our obligation under the Tax Receivable Agreement due to factors out of our control such as changes in tax rates, as well as periodic adjustments to our liability based, in part, on an updated estimate of the amounts that we expect to pay, using assumptions consistent with those used in our concurrent estimate of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance. Net tax (benefit) expense on remeasurement of deferred tax assets - During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, we recorded a decrease to our deferred tax valuation allowance of $1.4 million and $3.8 million, respectively, in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes, related to the remeasurement of deferred tax assets. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, we recorded a deferred tax valuation allowance of $348.6 million in accordance with ASC 740. This amount included tax expense of approximately $66.3 million related to our net change in the Tax Receivable Agreement liability or a net tax expense of $282.3 million related primarily to the remeasurement of deferred tax assets. (5) Represents an adjustment to weighted-average diluted shares outstanding to assume the full exchange of existing PBF LLC Series A Units as described in footnote 2. (6) Represents weighted-average diluted shares outstanding assuming the conversion of all common stock equivalents, including options and warrants for PBF LLC Series A Units and performance share units and options for shares of PBF Energy Class A common stock as calculated under the treasury stock method (to the extent the impact of such exchange would not be anti-dilutive) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Common stock equivalents exclude the effects of performance share units and options and warrants to purchase 11,113,779 and 11,041,279 shares of PBF Energy Class A common stock and PBF LLC Series A Units because they are anti-dilutive for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively. Common stock equivalents exclude the effects of performance share units and options and warrants to purchase 12,358,105 and 12,152,756 shares of PBF Energy Class A common stock and PBF LLC Series A Units because they are anti-dilutive for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively. For periods showing a net loss, all common stock equivalents and unvested restricted stock are considered anti-dilutive. (7) EBITDA (Earnings before Interest, Income Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization) and Adjusted EBITDA are supplemental measures of performance that are not required by, or presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA before adjustments for items such as stock-based compensation expense, the non-cash change in the fair value of catalyst obligations, gain on sale of hydrogen plants, the write down of inventory to the LCM, changes in the liability for Tax Receivable Agreement due to factors out of our control, such as changes in tax rates, (gain) loss on extinguishment of debt related to refinancing activities, change in the fair value of contingent consideration and certain other non-cash items. We use these Non-GAAP financial measures as a supplement to our GAAP results in order to provide additional metrics on factors and trends affecting our business. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are measures of operating performance that are not defined by GAAP and should not be considered substitutes for net income as determined in accordance with GAAP. In addition, because EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not calculated in the same manner by all companies, they are not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have their limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. (8) We operate in two reportable segments: Refining and Logistics. Our operations that are not included in the Refining and Logistics segments are included in Corporate. As of September 30, 2021, the Refining segment includes the operations of our oil refineries and related facilities in Delaware City, Delaware, Paulsboro, New Jersey, Toledo, Ohio, Chalmette, Louisiana, Torrance, California and Martinez, California. The Logistics segment includes the operations of PBF Logistics LP (""PBFX""), a growth-oriented master limited partnership which owns or leases, operates, develops and acquires crude oil and refined petroleum products terminals, pipelines, storage facilities and similar logistics assets. PBFX's assets primarily consist of rail and truck terminals and unloading racks, storage facilities and pipelines, a substantial portion of which were acquired from or contributed by PBF LLC and are located at, or nearby, our refineries. PBFX provides various rail, truck and marine terminaling services, pipeline transportation services and storage services to PBF Holding and/or its subsidiaries and third party customers through fee-based commercial agreements.PBFX currently does not generate significant third party revenue and intersegment related-party revenues are eliminated in consolidation. From a PBF Energy perspective, our chief operating decision maker evaluates the Logistics segment as a whole without regard to any of PBFX's individual operating segments. (9) As reported by Platts. (10) Gross refining margin and gross refining margin per barrel of throughput are Non-GAAP measures because they exclude refinery operating expenses, depreciation and amortization and gross margin of PBFX. Gross refining margin per barrel is gross refining margin, divided by total crude and feedstocks throughput. We believe they are important measures of operating performance and provide useful information to investors because gross refining margin per barrel is a helpful metric comparison to the industry refining margin benchmarks shown in the Market Indicators Tables, as the industry benchmarks do not include a charge for refinery operating expenses and depreciation. Other companies in our industry may not calculate gross refining margin and gross refining margin per barrel in the same manner. Gross refining margin and gross refining margin per barrel of throughput have their limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. (11) Represents refinery operating expenses, including corporate-owned logistics assets, excluding depreciation and amortization, divided by total crude oil and feedstocks throughput. (12) We define heavy crude oil as crude oil with American Petroleum Institute (API) gravity less than 24 degrees. We define medium crude oil as crude oil with API gravity between 24 and 35 degrees. We define light crude oil as crude oil with API gravity higher than 35 degrees. (13) The total debt to capitalization ratio is calculated by dividing total debt by the sum of total debt and total equity. This ratio is a measurement that management believes is useful to investors in analyzing our leverage. Net debt and the net debt to capitalization ratio are Non-GAAP measures. Net debt is calculated by subtracting cash and cash equivalents from total debt. We believe these measurements are also useful to investors since we have the ability to and may decide to use a portion of our cash and cash equivalents to retire or pay down our debt. Additionally, we have also presented the total debt to capitalization and net debt to capitalization ratios excluding the cumulative effects of special items on equity.

This investment is led by former Twitter CEO & COO, Dick Costolo and Adam Bain of 01A, with participation from Lachy Groom, Elad Gil, and Penny Jar Capital (a fund anchored by Stephen Curry), joining early insiders Crosscut Ventures, Freestyle Capital, and SaaS Ventures. This is the company's second financing announcement since their initial seed round in November 2020, which brings HiveWatch's total amount raised to $25 million. By enabling security teams to bring together data from their existing disparate physical security systems and providing them with an intelligent, holistic, and actionable view, HiveWatch is moving corporate safety operations from reactive-only responses to designing proactive programs that identify threats before they happen.HiveWatch, a technology company reimagining how companies keep their people and assets safe, today announced it has closed $20 million in additional growth funding.Tweet thisOverall violence in the United States skyrocketed during the pandemic. Violent crime increased and the homicide rate rose 30% in 2020, the single largest increase in a century*. In a survey conducted by Help Net Security -- an independent site providing news on technical security -- 71% of respondents believe a lack of protective intelligence resulted in missed threats and physical harm to customers and employees. Almost 100% of respondents agreed that physical security requires technology-driven standards to better identify, investigate, monitor and manage pending threats. As 2021 roars on, companies are expected to experience an influx of security threats, making the need for an increase to security budgets even more critical. HiveWatch enables every organization to mobilize and modernize their physical security with Multi-sensor Resolution™ and machine learning. Customers utilize HiveWatch's Security Fusion Platform™ to unite siloed security systems' data, analyze program design and team performance, and securely monitor disparate security systems. ""The future of physical security is fusion,"" says Ryan Schonfeld, Founder & CEO of HiveWatch. ""Technology leaders typically have physical security operations siloed because their legacy systems don't talk to each other and don't play nice with their cybersecurity tools. Orchestration, behavioral analysis, anomaly detection; these have been solved for cyber. We built HiveWatch to bring the physical side up to speed.""HiveWatch resonated with the former Twitter executives because of the pain they experienced scaling their physical security programs with their exponential growth.""When running a company, nothing is more important than your employees. Prioritizing their safety and security is imperative,"" says Adam Bain, Managing Partner at 01A. ""You spare no expense to do so but, the reality is that software and hardware products serving the enterprise physical security market are woefully inadequate. They're antiquated, disconnected from each other, and make responding to incidents impossibly slow. Physical security teams deal with multiple camera feeds, badge swipe alerts, IOT data streams, and disparate interfaces to monitor and respond to issues. When we saw what Ryan was building with HiveWatch, we instantly saw the value and the future of smart physical security. Keeping your team and your company's assets safe is easier and more efficient with HiveWatch."" Today's funding will help HiveWatch execute on new and existing strategies including:Helping security leaders gain the intelligence needed to make their teams more effective Building a better and more cohesive customer experience (a first of its kind for the security industry) Building a best in class engineering team focused on diversity and inclusion""I've lived with these problems my whole career. I'm excited to deliver a platform to help organizations get smarter about keeping their people safe"" says Schonfeld.About HiveWatch: HiveWatch is a Security Fusion Platform™ that allows security teams to bring together data from their existing disparate security systems and provides them with an intelligent, holistic, and actionable view, enabling them to respond to prioritized, ""de-noised"" risks. HiveWatch strives to revolutionize the tired and aged security industry and enable organizations to create security programs simpler by reducing data noise, complexities, and cost. HiveWatch accomplishes this through it's Multi-sensor Resolution™ algorithms. HiveWatch makes it easier for companies to keep their people, assets, and brands safe.

The company's proprietary platform mVECTA™ allows the company to screen and develop product candidates that can cross the blood-brain-barrier targeting novel and untapped neurological pathways as well as ocular targets in the eye via the blood-retinal-barrier. Travecta's mVECTA™ proprietary platform is built upon a deep understanding of the MFSD2A transporter protein and its function at the blood-brain-barrier as well as in other key physio-pathological conditions discovered by Dr. David Silver. The new chemical entities discovered through mVECTA™ have significant advantages over existing therapies and allow the company to address large patient populations with conditions that were previously hard to treat using existing modalities. Travecta focuses on biological pathways that have been clinically validated but where key biological targets have not been drugged or have been inadequately drugged due to the BBB challenge. To date, we have leveraged the mVECTA™ platform to design and test novel molecules with high brain penetration focused in the areas of pain, ophthalmology, neuro-oncology, neuropathic pain and neuro-inflammation.For more information, visit: https://travectatx.com/.ContactsInvestors: Argot PartnersJason Finkelstein212.600.1902 | [email protected] SOURCE Travecta Therapeutics Pte Ltd Related Links https://travectatx.com/",FALSE

The round was led by Partners of DST Global, who have previously led rounds in many prominent global fintechs such as Robinhood, Nubank, Chime, Revolut, and Wealthsimple. The round also recorded participation from Tiger Global, another prolific investor in the global fintech space, counting multiple unicorns in its portfolio. Alkeon Capital, as well as existing investors Accel and Lightspeed Venture Partners, also participated in the round. Zolve raises $40 Million Series AThe funding amount will be used to rapidly scale the company's financial services platform, with the funding round raising the 10-month old company's valuation to $210 million. Zolve provides immigrants bound to the U.S. with access to FDIC-insured bank accounts, high-limit credit cards, and debit cards on the basis of their home country credit score - without the need for an SSN (social security number) or U.S. credit history - while they are still in their home countries. Zolve is on course to become a full-stack financial services provider with products focused on instant remittance, insurance, and loans in the pipeline. Since launching in September 2021 more than 70,000 customers from Australia, Canada, Germany, India, and the United Kingdom, have signed up for Zolve. The new round of funding comes just 7 months after announcing a large seed round of $15 million which saw the participation of Accel, Lightspeed Venture Partners, and a host of other marquee investors. With these additional funds, Zolve intends to enhance the user experience for global citizens, allowing them to open their U.S. accounts in minutes. Moreover, the funds will help speed expansion of the service to more nationalities, increasing the number of people who can start building their financial futures from the moment they arrive in the U.S. Further, Zolve is looking to grow its partner network and recruit stellar talent in the U.S. and India to launch more products and open access to more countries.""While we intended to start with a small cohort of 500 users, we were oversubscribed by almost 90x from working professionals and students within the first few weeks. This incredible traction has been far beyond what we had envisioned and clearly demonstrates that there is a tangible need for a service that provides global citizens equitable access to financial products,"" said Raghunandan G ('Raghu'), CEO and Founder of Zolve. ""We look forward to expanding the scale and reach of our products, helping even more immigrants globally to achieve their dreams.""""Zolve is among the few startups I've seen that achieved product-market fit right out of the gate. Given that the U.S. is a country with immigrants in its DNA, it's surprising how long it has taken someone to solve the issues that new immigrants experience with the traditional banking system,"" said Anand Daniel of Accel. ""We're proud to be among the first to recognize the tremendous value that Zolve is creating by bringing its full-stack financial solutions to the global market for immigrants."" ""Access to tailored and fair financial products has a direct and meaningful impact on people's lives. We're incredibly excited to have invested in Zolve, and to support Raghu's vision of bringing world-class financial services products and experiences to immigrants in the US and other markets. The company's rapid acceleration, especially around customer acquisition and usage, is a reflection of the team's execution capability and significant unmet needs of Zolve's target customer base. We're excited for what the future holds and have high confidence in Zolve's future success,"" said Bejul Somaia, Partner, LightspeedAbout ZolveZolve is building a financial world without borders by developing financial services for global citizens.

The series has becomeMore news about: Nielsen","Nielsen","CHICAGO, Oct. 26, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Nielsen continues to dedicate itself to telling the story of the power of Black audiences, their diversity, and the representation of the collective Black community. According to ""Seeing and Believing: Meeting Black audience demand for representation that matters,"" the newest report in Nielsen's Diverse Intelligence Series, the U.S. Black population has a complex and powerful legacy that continues to shape countries and cultures around the world. Yet, when it comes to representation in media, the complexity that creates the richness of their experience is often lost, and when present, undervalued.As Black Americans continue to video stream, listen to radio and podcasts, as well as buy Black, they continue to lead the conversation and stay connected through social media -- having an unprecedented impact on brands and what consumers watch, purchase, and listen to.""As the media industry looks to be more inclusive of Black storytellers and brands look to grow their bottom lines and brand awareness with Black audiences, understanding who we are, where we're connected, and how we're changing is as important as ever. All of this work translates to the important acknowledgment of the value the Black community delivers 'for the culture' and beyond,"" says Charlene Polite Corley, VP, Diverse Insights & Partnerships, Nielsen.Key findings from the report include:Black America is taking control of both the economic and media influence they hold and they are using it to invest in Black experiences, Black communities, and Black content.Two out of three Black viewers are more likely to watch representative content and buy from brands that advertise in representative content. In 2020, Black Buying Power was at $1.57 Trillion. In 2021, Black viewing power was at 1.06 Trillion.The urgency to get representation right is real—it's a primary factor for the massive viewing levels Black audiences deliver and the shift in Black viewing power to platforms most representative of their community and identity group. But getting representation right is increasingly nuanced.According to the 2020 U.S. Census, 9% of America's rural population is Black; 16% of Black people in the U.S. report speaking a language other than English at home; people identifying as ""Black in combination with another race"" increased 89% in the last decade; and Afro-Latinos are 8% of today's U.S. Black population. 58% of Black audiences say there's still not enough representation of their identity group on screen. Nearly a quarter of the reported genres in Gracenote Inclusion Analytics reported zero representation of Black talent in recurring lead roles.The preference to connect with meaningful content extends to audio with traditional radio reaching 92% of the U.S. Black population each week, and this same group of listeners averaging over an hour and a half a week of streaming audio.Traditional radio continues to prove the power of its reach providing the gossip, pandemic guidance, and breaking news that's kept Black listeners connected this year, for over 21 million minutes a week. Black listeners aren't just streaming audio more than other audiences, they're listening closely when brands reach out—averaging a 73% brand recall for podcast ads. Social media's omnipresence within Black people's daily media routine continues as a source for nuanced content; digital influencers are an even more important touchpoint. 51% of Black people 18+ spend daily time on TikTok and 29% spend daily time on Instagram than their counterparts.Audience influence and advocacy are intertwined as Black creators and viewers across platforms unify to uproot exploitation within the media ecosystem and create a sense of urgency for social change.27% of credited writers were Black on the most representative broadcast and cable dramas for Black talent in the first quarter of 2021. 70% of representation isn't just for endemic networks: seven out of the 10 top dramas represented by Black talent aired on general audience networks.In the era of personalization and inclusion in media, Black audiences worldwide are looking to see both their collective and distinct experiences represented. Black America delivers over 1 trillion viewing minutes in a single quarter but is also twice as likely to feel portrayals of their identity group on T.V. are completely inaccurate. Jamaica has a culture with global influence, including places like the U.K. and 20% of the foreign-born Black population in the U.S. Nigeria is the most populous country in Africa, outsources global trends like Afrobeats and ""Nollywood"" films, and is considered home for 18% of foreign-born Black people in the U.S.Businesses need to demonstrate their understanding of the diverse segments within the Black community. Black men have a high on-screen presence in T.V. content with a 15.5% share of screen, but 44% of Black men feel that the content that portrayed their identity group on-screen was inaccurate. While the number of advertisers spending in traditional media focused on reaching African Americans has been up 16% since last summer, Black men are increasingly engaged outside of these platforms to find the forums that offer nuanced representation, connection, and solace. Black women are twice as likely compared to viewers overall to seek out content where they are seen on screen. Embracing the impact of historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) is a strong example of when brands show they understand the nuances of the Black experiences. It is the opportunity to connect with diverse communities on personal, culturally relevant levels.For more details and insights, download the full report here.

The series A was led by RRE Ventures and included participation from Link Ventures and existing investors Madrona Venture Group, Declaration Partners, and Redesign Health.Anomaly works with healthcare payers, claims clearinghouses and providers to integrate at key points in the claims lifecycle, identifying and preventing payment and billing errors before they occur. Using advanced machine learning that analyzes billions of medical and pharmacy claims across one of the largest and most diverse datasets, Anomaly streamlines the claims payment experience between payers and providers, reducing friction and ensuring trust and integrity in the process.Improper healthcare payments and related costs represent one of the most challenging problems in the U.S. healthcare system, contributing more than $300 billion, or one in every $10 spent, in unnecessary costs annually. The problem also continues to grow as the cost and complexity of care and billing increases.""Overpayments, billing errors, and the resulting administrative rework creates completely unnecessary conflict and adds costs to the healthcare system that ultimately the consumer is responsible for paying. Anomaly works to ensure that the right amount is paid the first time, so payers can feel confident about every single payment, and providers know they are compensated correctly,"" said Jacob Shiff, Anomaly's Co-Founder, President and Chief Operating Officer. ""We've brought together some of the best minds in healthcare and technology to solve this massive problem, because when there is less conflict, providers are happier, and patients are healthier.""Anomaly's leadership includes a cross section of top data science engineers, healthcare industry veterans, payment integrity experts, and leading investors that bring unmatched insight into solving the payments problem.

""The improper payments issue is constantly evolving and requires continuously learning AI to solve, which is why Anomaly is best positioned to make a difference in the market.""Ensuring payment accuracy in healthcare has become more complex in the value-based care era, as payers often have unique contractual relationships with each provider that increasingly include reimbursement tied to value. When errors or disputes occur, the resulting conflicts often exacerbate many of the existing challenges that plague the healthcare system, including provider burnout and abrasive clawback disputes. Both can have significant effects on patients, as provider burnout is proven to affect care quality, and reimbursement disputes can result in providers leaving insurers' networks.""Anomaly is tackling a structural point of friction across the U.S. healthcare market with a novel, data-first approach that benefits payers, providers, and patients alike,"" said Jason Black, General Partner at RRE Ventures.

The new fund will invest primarily in Seed to Series C stage B2B technology companies across four overlapping theses: the digitization of legacy industries, next-generation software and business tooling, marketplaces, and the future of work, retail, and health care.Continue ReadingThe Asymmetric Capital Partners founding team, from left, Partner and Chief Operating Officer Sarah Unger Biggs, Managing Partner Rob Biederman, Principal Nancy Chou, and Partner Sam Clayman.""I founded Asymmetric to build a new kind of venture firm, focused on partnering with world-class founders and providing operational support on their journeys,"" said Biederman, Asymmetric's Founder and Managing Partner. ""Venture capital is itself in the midst of profound structural change, as commoditized capital and reactionary sourcing give way to a service-oriented mentality and rigorous, genuine thought partnership between founders and investment firms. We see ourselves at the vanguard of that movement."" Biederman further noted his firm has been pleasantly surprised by the degree to which that organizing principle has resonated with founding teams despite a frenzied venture market, resulting in strong and often exclusive inbound deal flow.Aligned with its orientation toward companies offering the potential for long-term compounding in the private markets, the firm elected to raise its first fund exclusively from family office and value-additive high net worth individuals, with exclusively private equity,venture capital, and operating backgrounds. Asymmetric utilizes a robust network of senior Sales, Marketing, Finance, BD, HR, and IT executives at leading tech companies – referred to as Advisor Partners – to augment its organic sourcing effort and to diligence investment opportunities.After investment, the firm seeks to play an active role in value creation through strategic advisory and access to its network of founders, operators, advisors, and investment firms. Since its inception earlier this year, Asymmetric has closed a number of high-profile investments, including in Canvas, the Sequoia-backed diversity recruiting platform, Firstbase, the Andreesen Horowitz-backed remote work platform, and Clearco, the SoftBank-backed fintech platform. ""We were so excited to bring Rob and Asymmetric into our Series A,"" said Chris Herd, Founder & CEO of Firstbase. ""Rob truly understands the future of work space and adds an important perspective alongside a16z and the other investors in the round.""""Given his deep operating background as a founder, we've found Rob's insights on corporate strategy and execution to be invaluable,"" add Clearco co-Founders Andrew D'Souza and Michele Romanow.The firm intends both to lead rounds and to co-invest alongside other leading firms, typically writing equity checks from $2M to $10M, as well as partnering with its LPs and others on select larger deals.Unusual for a venture firm, the founding team at Asymmetric has both significant founder and private equity experience. Prior to founding Catalant while a student at Harvard Business School, Biederman worked as a private equity investor at Bain Capital and Goldman Sachs; he also teaches on scaling high tech companies at Harvard Business School. Partner Sam Clayman previously worked as a private equity investor at Sycamore Partners after graduating from Stanford Graduate School of Business, with earlier investment roles at Apax Partners and KKR. Partner and COO Sarah Unger Biggs comes from a similar private markets background at Bain Capital, Long Wharf Capital, and Goldman Sachs. Principal Nancy Chou joins with operating experience from London-based startup Beamery and previously worked as a private equity investor at Francisco Partners and investment banker in Goldman Sachs' Technology, Media, and Telecom group.About Asymmetric Capital PartnersFounded in late 2020, Asymmetric Capital Partners (""Asymmetric"") seeks to partner with disruptive technology and internet companies by offering founders, early investors, and limited partners transparent, research-driven, and operator-centric capital. The firm uses a thesis-driven approach to preemptively identify opportunities and takes pride in being both open-minded and rigorous in its investment approach. Asymmetric invests primarily in the Seed through Series C stages, with an aim to back visionary leaders seeking to disrupt large markets and, when sensible, to invest throughout a company's life cycle. In alignment with its Limited Partners, Asymmetric gravitates toward investment in businesses that it believes offer the prospect of durable compounding over time. The firm invests primarily across four broadly-defined theses: digitization of legacy industries, next-generation software and business tooling, marketplaces, and the disruption of time and place across work, retail, and health care.Press ContactKelsey Cullen, KCPR650.438.1063[email protected]SOURCE Asymmetric Capital Partners Related Links https://www.acp.vc",TRUE

The investment will be used to develop Risilience's leading analytics and SaaS platformMore news about: Risilience","Risilience","CAMBRIDGE, England, Oct. 21, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Risilience™, the leading climate change business platform, has announced a Series A investment of £6m from international investors led by IQ Capital. The investment will be used to develop Risilience's leading analytics and SaaS platform for corporate businesses to assess their climate change risks and manage their transformation to reach net zero emissions.Risilience's ambitious growth trajectory aligns well with businesses as they take action to combat climate change risks. Over the past two years, the team has been helping companies at the forefront of managing their risks from climate change, including Nestlé, Burberry, Reckitt, easyJet, Maersk, Informa, Abrdn, and AXA XL. The current corporate client base of Risilience has committed to remove a combined annual 240 million tonnes of CO2e emissions – the equivalent of the annual carbon emissions produced by Spain. A fifth of all large corporations have now committed to a net zero target, and many others are set to do so in coming months. Risilience estimates that inaction would significantly erode the earnings value of many businesses within the next few years from increased costs of carbon taxes and consumer and investor pressures. By proactively taking action to transform their businesses now, the business benefits far outweigh the implementation costs. However, achieving the net zero target is a long and complicated process for large organisations, and many businesses don't yet have a clear strategy in place to achieve this goal. Risilience provides solutions which apply the approaches pioneered by the Centre for Risk Studies at the University of Cambridge, Judge Business School, from which it spun out. Cambridge has a world-leading reputation for the application of climate science, combined with corporate finance and scenario development – using behavioural science and economic modelling. The Risilience platform incorporates datasets and tools for businesses to quantify the risks they face from inaction and assesses the benefits they will gain from deploying the right management strategies. The Series A funding round included lead investor IQ Capital, insurance multinational Tokio Marine, and US MIT alumni investment fund Castor Ventures. Dr Andrew Coburn, CEO of Risilience, said: ""We are delighted to have the support of IQ Capital, Tokio Marine Holdings, and Castor Ventures in our ambitious plan to provide world-class solutions for businesses to de-risk their exposure to climate change. We selected these investors for their ability to partner with us and add expertise and access to key market sectors.""Kerry Baldwin, Managing Partner of IQ Capital who led the round, commented: ""Risilience combines the technology, science, customer base and academic rigour to make a real and practical difference in the fight against climate change. This is an example of a British business helping the world's largest companies to achieve and evidence net zero transition.""Tokio Marine is investing in Risilience to facilitate new insurance products and services to protect commercial businesses from the risks of climate change and incentivise sustainable practices in their corporate client base. Castor Ventures, which builds diversified venture portfolios for alumni of Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is investing in Risilience to propagate emissions management technology in US businesses. About RisilienceRisilience is a deeptech, data-driven analytics platform enabling corporations operating around the world to understand the transformational benefits of effective enterprise risk management and how to prioritise implementation. Risilience brings a detailed understanding of management science to the challenges of transforming businesses. Resilience's products and services give business leaders a competitive advantage in managing their risks and opportunities from climate change and other enterprise risks through its application of research frameworks pioneered by the Cambridge Centre for Risk Studies at the University of Cambridge, Judge Business School. The Risilience platform's company-specific analysis provides detailed, quantified results to support strategic decision making and business planning while balancing investment requirements driven by future scenarios.The founders of Risilience are Dr Andrew Coburn, CEO; Professor Danny Ralph, Chairman; Dr Michelle Tuveson, Chief Client Officer; and Simon Ruffle, Chief Product Officer.

The acceptance for purchase by the Offeror of Notes tendered pursuant to the Offers is at the sole discretion of the Offeror and tenders may be rejected by the Offeror for any reason.Introduction to and Rationale for the OffersOn the terms and subject to the conditions contained in the Tender Offer and Consent Solicitation Memorandum, the Offeror (a) is inviting Noteholders (subject to the Offer and Distribution Restrictions contained herein) to tender their Notes for purchase by the Offeror or, if directed by the Offeror, upon the completion of the Acquisition, the Company or any of its affiliates, at the relevant Purchase Price together with Accrued Interest and, where applicable, the Early Tender Premium or Early Consent Premium, as applicable, and (b) as agent of the Company, is soliciting approval of the Noteholders, by extraordinary resolution at meetings convened by the Company, of (i) the waiver of the Change of Control put right expected to arise upon the completion of the Acquisition for each Series of Notes and (ii) certain modifications to the Conditions of each Series of Notes to grant a new put right to Noteholders in connection with the Acquisition and certain related and/or consequential modifications to the applicable Trust Deed, in each case subject to the Transaction Conditions being satisfied or waived by the Offeror.The Offeror is making the Offers and Proposals to holders in anticipation of the completion of the proposed acquisition by Market Bidco Limited to acquire the entire issued and to be issued ordinary share capital of the Offeror (the ""Acquisition"") in order to enable it or, if directed by the Offeror, upon the completion of the Acquisition, the Company or any of its affiliates, to acquire, subject to the satisfaction of the Transaction Conditions, all of the outstanding Notes that are validly tendered in the Offers. PaymentThe Offeror or, if directed by the Offeror, upon the completion of the Acquisition, the Company or any of its affiliates, will pay (i) the relevant Purchase Price for the relevant Notes validly tendered and accepted by the Offeror for purchase pursuant to the Offers; and (ii) Accrued Interest in respect of the Notes validly tendered and accepted for purchase pursuant to the Offers, on the Settlement Date for any Notes validly tendered at or prior to the Expiration Deadline and accepted by it for purchase pursuant to the Offers. Each Noteholder that validly tenders its Notes at or prior to the Early Deadline (and does not subsequently revoke such tender in the limited circumstances in which such revocation is permitted, subject to applicable law and provisions of the applicable Trust Deed) and whose Notes are accepted for purchase pursuant to the applicable Offer will receive, in addition to the Purchase Price and the relevant Accrued Interest, an additional cash payment for the tender of its Notes (the ""Early Tender Premium"") equal to £1.50 per £1,000 in principal amount of such Notes, payable by the Offeror or, if directed by the Offeror, upon completion of the Acquisition, the Company or any of its affiliates, on the Settlement Date.In addition, if any Noteholder does not validly tender its Notes in an Offer but (i) submits a voting instruction in favour of the relevant extraordinary resolution to approve the applicable Proposal that is received by the Tabulation and Tender Agent at or prior to the Early Deadline (and is not revoked, in the limited circumstances in which revocation is permitted under the Tender Offer and Consent Solicitation, subject to applicable law and provisions of the applicable Trust Deed) and (ii) the extraordinary resolution in respect of such Series is passed, the relevant supplemental Trust Deed is executed by the Company, the Guarantor and the Trustee and the Transaction Conditions are satisfied or waived, such Noteholder will receive an additional cash payment for its vote in favour of the relevant extraordinary resolution (the ""Early Consent Premium"") equal to £0.50 per £1,000 in principal amount of such Notes, payable by the Offeror or, if directed by the Offeror, upon completion of the Acquisition, the Company or any of its affiliates, on the Settlement Date.Change of Control WaiverThe Offeror, as agent of the Company, considers that the completion of the Acquisition would constitute a Change of Control under the relevant Trust Deeds. The Offeror, as agent of the Company, is therefore soliciting consents from Noteholders for a one-time waiver of the Change of Control put right which would otherwise give Noteholders the right to require the Company to purchase their Notes at the applicable price set forth under the relevant Trust Deed upon completion of the Acquisition following the occurrence of a Rating Downgrade.If given effect, the Change of Control Waiver would mean that upon the completion of the Acquisition and in the event of a Rating Downgrade, the Noteholders would not have the right to require the Company to redeem or purchase Notes pursuant to the relevant Condition. However, the Change of Control provisions of the Notes would continue to apply in respect of any future relevant events (other than the Acquisition).Put RightThe Put Right, if approved by Noteholders of the relevant Series, will give each Noteholder the option to require the Company to redeem that Noteholder's Notes at their principal amount plus Accrued Interest during a put period beginning from the date of the approval of the relevant extraordinary resolution and the execution of the relevant Supplemental Trust Deed (the ""Effective Date"") and ending five calendar days following the Effective Date.Indicative TimetableThe expected timetable of events will be as follows:Date and Time (all times are London time, unless otherwise stated) Action 21 October 2021 Commencement of the Offers and Notices of Meetings for Proposals Offers and Meetings announced by way of announcements on the relevant RIS (as defined below), through the Clearing Systems and through the regulatory news service of the London Stock Exchange.

The Series A funding was led by New Legacy Ventures and included investments from Lockheed Martin Ventures, Catapult Ventures, JS Capital, Hardware Club, and individual investments from several Silicon Valley luminaries.The novel SiPhOG replaces the discrete optical components of a traditional Fiber Optic Gyroscope (FOG) and combines high precision with greatly reduced size, weight, power and cost. The technology combines an Anello-developed on-chip waveguide manufacturing process integrated with a patented silicon photonic chip-scale gyroscope. Together, these enable FOG performance using cost-effective and scalable silicon manufacturing processes. This breakthrough sensor technology has applications across a range of markets including Automotive, Trucking, Construction, Drone, Aerospace, Defense and Consumer Electronics.

With Hunt Club, a search for talent is focused on quality - not quantity.Godard Abel, CEO of Chicago unicorn G2.com and Hunt Club customer agreed, ""Hunt Club helped G2 hire over 50 key roles across our executive, product, marketing, and sales teams. These hires have turned out to be some of our top performers. We landed better talent faster because Hunt Club's network-based process is so advanced. They helped us land multiple key diverse leaders that our network, board, and leadership team lacked exposure to. Hunt Club has not only helped G2 but also has a leading 4.8 star review score from their trusted customers on our platform.""Oak Street Health, which IPOed in 2020, has also had success with Hunt Club's model. ""Last year Hunt Club helped us scale across our VP layer and added exceptional talent across technology, data science, customer service, sales, and other departments. Their talent network and technology has routinely outperformed other talent models, "" shared Geoff Price, Co-Founder and Chief Operating Officer of Oak Street Health. Technology + How It WorksWhen a search is kicked off at Hunt Club, their technology begins mapping their Talent Expert Network looking for relevant candidates based on criteria that predict job compatibility matching. When candidates are identified, the technology pings individual experts in the club's network for a warm introduction to the candidate. When a candidate is hired via a referral through the system, the expert is rewarded with a monetary referral bonus. Hunt Club has taken internal referral bonuses and flipped them into an external referral network that incentivizes and rewards connections. Imagine 100 top CMOs helping you find your next VP of Marketing. That's Hunt Club. Stephen Schmalhofer, Partner at Teamworthy Ventures and new Hunt Club Board Member said, ""After experiencing firsthand the power of Hunt Club's multi-sided talent network to help our portfolio companies, our team saw that Hunt Club was developing a category-defining recruiting platform that is built to solve the urgent problem of finding the right talent and providing a great experience for candidates, employers, and recruiting teams. We've been impressed by their remarkable progress, scaling revenue, growing headcount from approximately 20 to 120 in a short period, and bringing on several talented new business and product leaders to serve the market demand."" This round of funding complements the company's Seed Round of $4.5M with key investors such as Brian Spaly (Chairman of Tecovas, founder of Bonobos and Trunk Club), Woodie Levin (CEO and founder of Extend), FJ Labs, Starting Line Ventures, Network Ventures and more. Hunt Club works with high-growth start-ups, unicorns, and companies looking to build the best teams including gopuff, Typeform, G2, Nerdy, Dollar Shave Club, Terminus, and Oak Street Health.People + Tech = Full Customer SolutionWhile many technology companies have tried to take the recruiter out of the process, Hunt Club has taken a different approach, building a team of high-performance recruiters who provide white-glove service to customers. Powered by Hunt Club's proprietary Talent Expert Network and candidate mapping/referral technology, Hunt Club recruiters have an unfair advantage - often closing searches for customers in half the time it takes the competition. By reducing the candidate volume (the majority of Hunt Club jobs are not posted on external job boards) and focusing on high-quality referrals and trusted network recruiting, Hunt Club sources the most relevant candidates with the highest propensity for cultural and skill fit. ""We believe that the best recruiters in the world have incredibly valuable networks that they cultivate and curate. With our network mapping and referral technology, we can turn any one of our 100+ talent team members into the most connected recruiter,"" shared CEO & Co-Founder Nick Cromydas. ""Rather than trying to disintermediate the recruiter, we invest in our product and engineering team so we can quickly build the best technology and tools to give our recruiters an unfair sourcing advantage. This is still a people-powered business today, and when you're competing with other companies to hire a candidate who has 4 offers, the right digital candidate experience and human touch both matter"".Today's War for Talent is Heating Up The pandemic has created turmoil in the workplace, instigating ""The Great Resignation"" with close to 55% of Americans currently looking for new jobs. Complicating the hiring market even further, 2021 has marked a record-setting year in venture capital funding, with more VC dollars invested in the first quarters of 2021 than ever before. The influx of cash has created competition for talent at historic proportions with startups and larger companies alike undergoing digital transformation and fighting to secure the same top talent.The hiring environment is equally unconventional. According to Hunt Club's data, over 85% of their customers have lifted the requirement for a candidate to relocate to the company's headquarters. Similarly, the average candidate now is negotiating their initial offer more than 28% due to market factors, up from 9% in 2019. The traditional tool kits, technology, and reliance on local recruiters with dense local networks won't win in tomorrow's war for talent as companies are facing increasing pressure to compete financially and expand their talent pool nationally.Companies are also striving to build diverse teams. With Hunt Club's platform, their recruiting team has access to top diverse business leaders across every function, industry, and seniority level, unlocking warm referrals to hard-to-reach candidates across the country and around the world. ""Our network-based approach helps our clients connect with diverse and difficult to reach talent, giving them an entirely new talent pool to access. This includes candidates in geographic areas previously untouched by their in-house recruiting team, diverse candidates with no affiliation to the customer, and relationships of trust that would otherwise go overlooked,"" said Cromydas.What's Next With a growing database of 6 Million quality candidates, referred from their network of over 12,000 subject matter experts, the funding will enable further development of their machine learning technology that automates much of the recruiting process, will further facilitate Hunt Club's impressive growth of its Talent Expert Network, expand the company's talent team, leadership, and help expand the company's headcount to over 150+ by end of the year, with plans to scale to 300 by 2022. ""Companies face unprecedented headwinds with the competition for talent getting tougher every day. You used to only compete with companies in your backyard for talent. Now the whole world can hire anyone, anywhere. At Hunt Club we are taking on this goliath problem, bringing technology innovation to a market in need of disruption. We empower our team with an unparalleled hiring network and technology automation so they can work faster, smarter, and beat the competition by securing the best talent for a role,"" said Nick Cromydas, CEO and Co-Founder of Hunt Club. ""At the end of the day, we believe the one thing that will always turn a passive candidate into an active one, is a trusted introduction. By 2024, our goal is to have the entire management workforce available via a trusted introduction. Our technology powers that at scale, and when you're an LA-based company trying to hire the best marketing leader anywhere, you need trust to bridge the relationship gap. Hunt Club powers trust.""

With this growth, Equip is now able to serve half the country – over 160 million patients and their families – through Family-Based Treatment (FBT) delivered at home for lasting recovery.""We've long known how widespread and detrimental eating disorders can be – and the recent news from Facebook shows that younger generations are continuing to suffer,"" said Kristina Saffran, CEO and co-founder of Equip. ""Our mission at Equip is to ensure that every family has access to affordable eating disorder treatment that works. We're making major strides toward that goal as we expand into these critical states, bringing the gold-standard of treatment to millions."" Equip, the leading provider of evidence-based eating disorder treatment in the U.S., expanded into CO, FL, GA, + ILTweet thisEating disorders, which have the second highest mortality rate of all mental illnesses, will impact over 30 million Americans throughout their lifetime. A nationwide shortage of qualified behavioral health providers and the lack of cost-effective care means that less than 5 percent of eating disorder patients in the U.S. receive treatment that works. Equip's FBT model – which empowers families to help their loved ones through recovery at home with a dedicated team of clinicians and mentors with lived experience – promises superior, lasting outcomes for patients. Close to 70 percent of Equip patients report reduction in eating disorder symptoms, and 98 percent of families are still in treatment after four weeks. Equip will be covered by Optum immediately in CO, FL, and IL, and in GA in November, with more insurance plans coming soon. While many status quo eating disorder treatment options – like residential treatment centers – cost upwards of $30k per month, insurance coverage is often spotty at best. It is estimated that Americans' total out-of-pocket payments for eating disorder treatment topped $363 million in 2019. Equip, in its mission to make quality care accessible to anyone with an eating disorder, is also in-network with Cigna, Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield, Pacific Source, and Aetna in other states. ""The access gap in eating disorder care is wide and deep,"" said Susannah Fox, former Chief Technology Officer of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and advisor to Equip. ""As someone dedicated to using technology to power healthcare innovation, I am energized by Equip's model that is bringing this mental illness out of the shadows and providing critical care for those who need it most.""Equip was founded in 2019 by Kristina Saffran and Erin Parks, PhD, and raised $13 million in Series A funding earlier this year.

Uncorrelated Ventures, Y Combinator, 2048 Ventures, Knoll Ventures, I2BF, Hack VC and Navitas Capital also participated in the latest round.Lendflow enables every SaaS company to become a fintech. Lendflow's white label solution allows vertical SaaS technology companies servicing small and medium businesses (B2SMB) to easily build, enhance or embed financial products within their ecosystem and offer hyper-contextual financing solutions. The way in which small businesses access credit has shifted away from being a standalone activity handled by a financial institution, to a more contextual, in-workflow manner, offered and managed by companies that intimately understand their SMB customers. These companies are in a better position to use the data, knowledge, and relationships with their existing customers to deliver a superior financial product experience at a lower cost. ""The idea of contextual lending isn't new; in-market lending services have existed for some time, but historically, it took a tremendous amount of effort and time for a product or service provider to become a lender,"" said Jon Fry, CEO, Lendflow. ""We've built a platform on which software companies can quickly launch financial products tailored to their audience. This promotes higher user engagement, increases revenue per user, and decreases churn. We're excited to execute alongside new partners, including Underscore VC, as they're deeply committed to the vertical SaaS space, and that added expertise will be crucial as we enter this next phase of growth.""

""Our team has had conversations with hundreds of family offices around the globe, helping them access the venture ecosystem through Fund of Funds, direct VC funds or directly into world class startups. The key observation from those conversations, further validated by this year's report, is that most family offices follow a similar path when investing in venture. Most start by investing in fund of funds to gain access to established (and often access-constrained) venture funds, while also making ad-hoc investments based on recommendations by friends and other family offices, and finally invest directly into venture funds and startups. ""With so many exciting and potentially transformative technological innovations occurring – in blockchain, AI, machine learning, the Internet of Things, and so on – it is quite understandable that venture investment continues to set records around the world,"" said Dominic Samuleson, CEO of Campden Wealth. ""Family offices are becoming increasingly sophisticated VC investors – developing their networks and building in-house expertise – and their VC investments are growing, quickly. I am delighted that we have been able to, once again, collect this highly scarce information from our global network of experienced families to support newer entrants.""Global findingsFollowing are the key findings from SVB Capital and Campden Wealth's global report, which surveyed 139 representatives of ultra-high net worth (UHNW) families and family offices with experience in innovation and venture capital investing between June and September 2021. Participants represented family offices in offices in North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, Latin America and the Middle East. In addition to the survey, in-depth follow on interviews were conducted with 10 family office representatives. The responding single-family offices had an average of $989 million assets under management (AUM) and the responding multi-family offices had an average of $1.9 billion AUM. The full report is available at https://www.fa-mag.com/news/family-offices-raise-bets-on-start-ups-in--418-billion-market-64301.html. Family offices progress through a similar path in their venture capital investing journeyAlthough every family office is unique, their venture investing journeys are similar. Most start investing in fund of funds, then venture funds, and finally directly into startups.Family office participation in venture continues to increaseStartups are increasingly open to direct investments from family offices, alongside venture funds. Family offices, in turn, are investing strategic capital, adding value based on their operating businesses and network connections. The average family office venture portfolio comprises 17 direct investments and 10 fund investments, and within the next 24 months, family offices expect to make 18 new investments. Sixty-seven percent of family offices rely on their existing network for deal flowThe best venture deals continue to be hard to access. Most family offices rely on their existing networks, GPs of venture funds, founders, and other family offices for deal flow.

ETI's cost-effective, scalable technology is designed to selectively remove GAL-3 from blood plasma. In a significant number of acute and chronic progressive conditions, GAL-3 is an important mediator and key driver of organ inflammation and fibrosis. There is preclinical and clinical evidence that removing or inhibiting GAL-3 represents a potential treatment for many of these conditions that don't have an effective treatment today. ETI's initial focus is on Acute Kidney Injury (AKI). AKI has been labeled the deadliest disease that most people have never heard of. Annual AKI cases in the US are estimated to be at least 4,000,000, deaths at 500,000, and long-term health consequences for many patients who recover. The XGAL3® therapeutic apheresis device is the early-mover for the treatment of AKI. ETI has demonstrated significant survival benefits in preclinical models and their prototype device has successfully removed GAL-3 from human blood plasma.

Each year's program will bring together compelling groups of artists with diverse backgrounds, perspectives, and aesthetics to offer their unique takes on Away's best-selling travel products. ""Away's designer collaboration series is an exciting new chapter for our brand which I'm thrilled to introduce to our global community of travelers, as well as to the dedicated fans of Sandy, Tia, and Ji. It has been an honor to see how these three astonishingly talented designers infused their personal ethos of style into Away's streamlined design sensibility,"" said Away CEO and co-founder, Jen Rubio. ""The resulting collections are distinct, vivid, and evocative takes on classic Away products. This is an exciting start to our annual collaboration program and eager to see how future iterations come together!"" For the inaugural collection, the three New York based designers were asked to outfit Away's Large Everywhere Bag, Front Pocket Backpack, and Travel Pouch Set with their own take on modern design. The resulting products reflect each designer's unique point of view; informed by the places, people, and experiences that have shaped their aesthetic identity. New York City native, Sandy Liang says her collection, which features an energetic and wavy floral pattern, was inspired by ""the playful wanderlust people are feeling towards travel right now. I was excited to take some of Away's products that lend themselves to more regional and domestic travel, and outfit them with a bold print that is colorful and loud, but on the Away products, looks more like a floral camo.""""I have been a longtime admirer of Away and love the fact that it is a female-founded company. It's important to me that I partner with like-minded companies, so teaming up with Away was a no-brainer,"" said Tia Adeola, Nigerian-born, and London-raised fashion designer. Adeola, whose collection features a custom-developed, multi-colored, tweed accented with a pink ruffle, says her work is largely focused on ""restructuring the representation of female bodies in the 21st century, challenging constructs with statement pieces that are meant for the everyday, and rewriting history through fashion."" Born in Seoul and raised in Oklahoma, Ji Won Choi says her designs are ""mainly inspired by travel --different cultures, places, and people-- so working with Away was really the perfect partnership for me.

Inspired by her background in Art History and deep interest in the Renaissance period, Tia created the first iteration of her brand, Slashed by Tia, in 2016 in her dorm room at The New School. Slashed by Tia quickly amassed a diverse and passionate fanbase that includes women like Gigi Hadid and SZA and press support from Surface, Wonderland, Glamour, Hypebae, and Paper Magazine. Ahead of her first official runway show at New York Fashion Week February 2020, Tia changed the name of her brand from Slashed by Tia to Tia Adeola, solidifying the brand's place in the luxury fashion space. The show became one of the breakout shows of the week with a packed venue and garnering press from Vogue, WWD, Teen Vogue, ELLE, Essence, i-D, Office Magazine, and many more. In the fall of 2020, Tia designed and produced her first fashion film, titled ""Black is Beautiful,"" which was nominated in five categories at the 2021 International Fashion Film Awards. Tia has recently been featured in profile stories in New York Magazine, CNN, and was named one of Bloomberg's ""Ones to Watch"" for this next upcoming season.About Sandy LiangSandy Liang is a New York based-and-bred designer who draws energy and inspiration for her collections from the magnetism of childhood memory and unsung neighborhood spirit, from chefs in aprons smoking behind restaurant doors to grandmothers shuffling on Canal Street in wide-leg printed pants. Liang grew up in Bayside, Queens, and after briefly attending Rhode Island School of Design for architecture, transferred to Parsons to study fashion design. As a designer, her roots are firmly in outerwear, the structure, materiality and identity of which has informed her work since her first collection ten seasons ago. With elevated detailing and beautiful fabrics (leather, shearling, mink and more), Liang explores the memories of comfort from winter coats on the school playground, her first impressions of silhouette and color from 90s brands that she saw on the street in New York as a kid, and the wit of cartoon-y, playful influences. Each collection builds on the last, with thoughtfulness and consistency that is uncommon in a young brand. Liang innovates within the range of emotionality that inspires her and is very much a biographical designer. Her designed memories have their own luxury, longevity and wit, are enjoyable to observe, sumptuous to touch yet easy to appreciate.About Ji Won ChoiBorn in Seoul, raised in Oklahoma, educated in NYC and Paris, and worked in Milan, Ji Won Choi graduated from Parsons School of Design in 2017. She presented her thesis collection, EXCESSIVISM, at the Parsons Benefit in May 2017.

The round wasMore news about: Shift5","Shift5","ARLINGTON, Va., Oct. 12, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Shift5, an OT cybersecurity company that defends military platforms and commercial transportation systems from cyberattacks, raised $20 million in Series A funding to provide enhanced cybersecurity and operational intelligence for today's commercial fleet operators and military platforms. The round was led by 645 Ventures, with participation from Squadra Ventures, General Advance, and First In. Shift5 announces its Series A funding, led by 645 Ventures, to defend planes, trains, and tanks from cyberattacks.Amid high-impact cyberattacks targeting infrastructure, Shift5 to secure commercial and military transportation systemsTweet thisOperational technology underpins critical infrastructure, enabling it to run continuously and reliably. Transportation fleets — aircrafts, railways, military vehicles — rely on OT to move millions of people, power the supply chain, and defend national security. However, legacy OT was developed before the emergence of widespread digital connectivity and modern standards for cybersecurity, resulting in a lack of comprehensive visibility into data and resilience against cyberattacks. Today, digital components and control networks are deeply embedded in planes, trains, and military vehicles, creating an attack surface that remains unsecured. With mobility and uptime requirements, securing OT that enables fleets to run is a significant challenge for CISOs charged with their defense. Shift5 protects OT powering a critical and unprotected part of infrastructure from cyberattacks and operational failures by detecting cyber threats and equipment malfunction that could lead to costly operational failures and catastrophic risk. Led by a team of founding members of the U.S. Army Cyber Command and proven cybersecurity leadership, Shift5 was built on the premise that the infrastructure powering the United States' transportation systems is inherently vulnerable, unique from other industrial control systems, and requires a novel and rigorous approach to defense.""The increasing rate of cyber physical attacks against national infrastructure has exposed the digital insecurity of the U.S. systems that underpin modern society. Successful cyberattacks triggered gasoline and meat shortages and public transportation outages, impacting the daily lives of thousands and incurring downstream costs to impacted businesses,"" said Josh Lospinoso, co-founder and CEO, Shift5. ""Defending the cyber-physical attack surface of planes, trains, and tanks is a national security imperative. This fresh financing represents significant investment in hiring world-class talent, advancing Shift5's platform, and bringing cybersecurity to the trillions of dollars in fleet assets moving the world.""Shift5's funding occurs on top of significant government contract work that has fueled business and technology growth, including a new contract with the U.S. Army's Rapid Capabilities and Critical Technologies Office (RCCTO) to configure Shift5's commercial technology on Army combat vehicles. The company is trusted to provide enhanced cybersecurity and operational intelligence to protect today's commercial fleet operators and military platforms, including the U.S. Army, U.S. Air Force, U.S. Navy, and several of the largest U.S. passenger rail systems. ""When we talk about defending OT for transportation infrastructure assets, it's with the understanding that the margin for error is miniscule. Shift5's roots in military spaces means these stakes were present from the get-go,"" said Joe Lea, President, Shift5. ""Such standards have enabled us to work with like-minded partners in the federal space, and have increasingly opened the doors to conversations with leading commercial rail and airline security officers. Our discussions are similar: transportation is infrastructure that drives global economic performance, that millions of people rely on daily, and that defends the nation; lacking the ability to defend it is unacceptable.""Shift5's data-driven solution integrates directly onto existing vehicle platforms, collecting and enriching data from on-board digital components and continuously monitoring data streams for security and operational anomalies. Its analytics platform provides cybersecurity intrusion detection, smarter maintenance, and improved operational intelligence for fleet operators. Further capabilities allow for firmware and configuration attestation and the ability to protect assets by neutralizing malicious or corrupted payloads. Shift5 also provides specialized services for operational technology cybersecurity areas, such as vulnerability research and capability development.""Shift5 represents the best of what 645 looks for in an investment: a talented, driven and experienced team building a differentiated technology company to solve a critical and growing problem,"" said Nnamdi Okike, Co-Founder and Managing Partner, 645 Ventures. ""The challenge of monitoring and securing commercial and government fleets, vehicles, and systems against cyberattack and malfunction is one of the most important in cybersecurity today. We're excited to partner closely with them as they scale the business."" Shift5 was recently named a Cool Vendor in Gartner's Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) Security report, recognized for its range of capabilities to collect, compress, and transmit critical vehicle information and continuously monitor the security of vehicles and fleets.About Shift5 Shift5 is the OT cybersecurity company that protects the world's transportation infrastructure and weapons systems from cyberattacks. Created by founding members of the U.S. Army Cyber Command who pioneered modern weapons system cyber assessments, Shift5 defends military platforms and commercial transportation systems against malicious actors and operational failures.

Through a web-based platform and human connection, Tilt guides employees and their employers through a research-based, inclusive approach to retention, engagement, and effective life transitions. Tilt removes the guesswork, alleviates the busywork, reduces fear, and protects from legal vulnerabilities to provide a consistent, seamless leave experience.Tilt Leadership left to right: VP of Sales Jessi Johanson, CTO Royce Haynes, CEO Jen Henderson, COO Kait Feeney, and VP of Customer Success Anthony Edwards. (Photo: Tilt)Today, Tilt announced it has completed a $7.4 million Series A funding round. The investment is led by Firework Ventures, with participation from existing investors, including Matchstick Ventures, Rockies Venture Club, Sofia, Foursight and other angels.""We started Tilt when we recognized, and experienced firsthand, the major flaws in the current way most companies handle employee leave,"" said Jen Henderson, Tilt Founder and CEO. ""Our mission was to develop an effective tech-based solution to improve the experience for all parties involved with an employee's leave process. With our Series A funding, we will be able to continue engineering an experience that turns current leave management systems on their heads, and for once offers employees a humanized support tool during their most challenging times.""With Tilt, organizations know every leave will be handled consistently and correctly through their software because it incorporates real-time updates to legislative changes and subsequent compliance changes. While their tech solution has its eyes on a leave revolution, Tilt's human touch is a true revelation. Dedicated one-to-one support offers the industry's only human-focused approach to leave management. People have questions because leave can be complicated, and Tilt's in-house experts and intuitive software are at the ready to reduce confusion, anxiety and ensure every customer gets leave right.""At Firework, we invest in companies leading the future of work,"" said Brigette Lau, Founding Partner at Firework Ventures. ""Tilt is a great example of a company humanizing work by focusing on the leave process. We were excited by Tilt's mission--to reimagine leave--and even more excited by Jen and her team. We are thrilled to be partnering with Tilt for the next phase of the company's journey.""""I personally experienced the antiquated and ineffective leave process so many others have faced in companies large and small,"" said Jen. ""I knew there had to be a better way, so I sought out to create a solution that tangibly improves the way companies manage leave to support their employees through some of their most vulnerable and transformational life moments.""The paid leave experience has always been a complex and dynamic one for companies to navigate, and the pandemic has only elevated its importance as a benefit employees now expect as table stakes from their employer. As the 10%-15% of employees worldwide taking some form of leave every year continues its upward trajectory, so too does the demand of leave support from employers. Companies today need to ensure the leave of absence process is done correctly and effectively across the board, and the process is not getting any easier post-Covid.The growing trend of remote work has created a new set of challenges for businesses as leave requirements often differ depending on the city and state the employee resides in. Many HR departments are ill-equipped to understand and manage their employee leave correctly from a compliance and employee-engagement perspective. This puts all companies at risk of missing out on incentives, losing valuable employees, and making them susceptible to legal action. As the employee population continues its seismic shift toward remote work, companies need a comprehensive software to solve this problem.Leaves take many forms - maternity, paternity, and grief for the loss of a loved one being just a few examples. Businesses spend large amounts of time managing the compliance regulations and hurdles that each unique leave brings, and if done incorrectly, their employees can experience career disruption, discrimination, loss of income and may not return to the workplace. The risk of litigation from any of these outcomes is real and should never be ruled out.About TiltTilt is a leave of absence tech and service solution company that offers organizations peace of mind by streamlining the entire process. This not only frees up time, but also makes sure that each leave is handled properly, effectively, and with care, while allowing companies to recoup some of their expenses through state and local government incentives. Tilt has vastly improved the way leave of absence can be done, resulting in increased employee retention, engagement, and better leave policies, making it an invaluable investment for any business.

(4) Includes the Early Tender Premium. (5) Hypothetical Total Consideration for each series of Securities is based upon a hypothetical Reference Yield (as defined below) determined as of 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on October 5, 2021 and assumes a Settlement Date of October 25, 2021. The Reference Yield used to determine actual consideration for the Securities is expected to be calculated as of 9:00 a.m., New York City time on October 21, 2021. The information provided in the above table with respect to the Securities is for illustrative purposes only. The Company and the Dealer Managers (as defined below) make no representation with respect to the actual consideration that may be paid with respect to the Securities, and such amounts may be greater or less than those shown in the above table depending on the Reference Yield as of the Price Determination Date (as defined below).

The Total Consideration for each series of Securities validly tendered and accepted for purchase will be determined in the manner described in the Offer to Purchase by reference to the applicable fixed spread over the yield to maturity based on the bid side price of the applicable Reference U.S. Treasury Security specified in the table above and in the Offer to Purchase. In calculating the applicable Total Consideration for a Series of Securities, the application of the par call date, if any, will be in accordance with standard market practice. Holders of Securities who validly tender their Securities following the Early Tender Deadline and on or prior to the Expiration Date will only receive the applicable Tender Offer Consideration per $1,000 principal amount of any such Securities validly tendered by such Holders that are accepted for purchase. The ""Tender Offer Consideration"" is equal to the applicable Total Consideration minus the Early Tender Premium. The Total Consideration and Tender Offer Consideration will be determined at 9:00 a.m., New York City time, October 21, 2021, unless extended by PepsiCo.In addition to the Tender Offer Consideration or the Total Consideration, as applicable, all Holders of Securities accepted for purchase will also receive accrued and unpaid interest rounded to the nearest cent, on such $1,000 principal amount of Securities from the last applicable interest payment date to, but not including, the applicable settlement date.The settlement date for Securities validly tendered and not validly withdrawn at or prior to the Early Tender Deadline and accepted for purchase is expected to be October 25, 2021, the third business day after the Early Tender Deadline (the ""Early Settlement Date""). The settlement date for Securities validly tendered following the Early Tender Deadline but on or prior to the Expiration Date and accepted for purchase is expected to be November 5, 2021, the second business day after the Expiration Date, assuming that the Maximum Tender Amount of Securities is not purchased on the Early Settlement Date.Subject to the Maximum Tender Amount and proration, all Securities validly tendered and not validly withdrawn at or prior to the Early Tender Deadline having a higher Acceptance Priority Level (with 1 being the highest) will be accepted before any validly tendered Securities having a lower Acceptance Priority Level (with 14 being the lowest), and all Securities validly tendered following the Early Tender Deadline having a higher Acceptance Priority Level will be accepted before any Securities validly tendered following the Early Tender Deadline having a lower Acceptance Priority Level. If the Offers are not fully subscribed at the Early Tender Deadline, subject to the Maximum Tender Amount and proration, Securities validly tendered and not validly withdrawn at or prior to the Early Tender Deadline will be accepted for purchase in priority to other Securities validly tendered following the Early Tender Deadline even if such Securities validly tendered following the Early Tender Deadline have a higher Acceptance Priority Level than Securities validly tendered at or prior to the Early Tender Deadline.

""It's clear that as more and more people gain access to the promise of capital markets, they need a transparent space to share knowledge and ideate, which is exactly what we've built. Our goal is to amplify great knowledge and insights, drawing everyone from the most legendary investors to those wanting to bring their investing skills to the next level. We're excited to expand our platform to support even more investors and creators.""Since Commonstock launched out of stealth in August 2020, it has quickly become a hub for retail investors, with more than a billion in assets connected on the platform. Commonstock works by connecting users' existing brokerage accounts to the app so that they can share their real-time portfolio by percentage (not dollar amount), performance, and trades. Users will get real-time alerts when friends buy or sell, so they can copy each other's trades and invest together. They also have the opportunity to participate in discussions about investment theses and industry takedowns. The influence of active retail investors is on the rise, now making up 15% of current U.S. stock market investors. But while technology and lower trading costs have made this possible, retail investors have no more access to investing knowledge than they did a decade ago. The GameStop craze earlier this year established that there is tremendous value in going online to share investment ideas but more transparency and accountability are needed. By linking user profiles to brokerage accounts that show current performance and investments, the platform aims to establish transparency between what a user is saying and what they're actually investing.ABOUT COMMONSTOCKCommonstock is a social network that amplifies the knowledge of the best investors, verified by actual track records for signal over noise.

InsightRX, which has developed a cloud-based platform for precision dosing and clinical analytics, was chosen from more than 60 companies seeking to be among the first group of collaborators. The MSK Innovation Hub is a program that brings together health technology innovators and a community of researchers, clinicians, and digital health professionals who will develop cutting-edge healthcare products designed to transform cancer care. ""It truly is an honor for InsightRX to be selected as an MSK Innovation Hub collaborator,"" said Sirj Goswami, PhD, CEO and co-founder of InsightRX. ""Working together, we can accelerate the development of precision medicine modules for oncology products that will help improve care for cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.""The New York-based cancer center identified four areas of investment for the program's debut group: digital therapeutics, AI-enabled computational oncology, population insights, and remote patient monitoring. As a collaborator in the AI-enabled computational oncology area, InsightRX will focus on validating and potentially improving pharmacology models used in its InsightRX Nova precision dosing platform to enable clinicians to predict neutropenia, a blood disorder commonly caused by chemotherapy. Clinicians can independently review all pharmacology models in the Nova platform.Neutropenia is a potentially fatal condition in which a person's level of neutrophils (a type of white blood cell) is abnormally low, reducing the body's ability to fight infection. When chemotherapy kills healthy white blood cells along with cancer cells, it can result in cancer patients becoming neutropenic. Infections linked to neutropenia are among the most serious side effects of chemotherapy, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which cites studies showing that 60,000 cancer patients in the U.S. are hospitalized with neutropenia each year, with 4,000 dying of neutropenia-related fever. A study published in the Journal of Oncology Practice estimated the cancer-related neutropenia hospitalizations in the U.S. cost $2.3 billion for adults and $439 million for children in 2012, totaling 8.3% of all cancer-related hospitalization costs. ""We created the MSK Innovation Hub because we know collaboration can spark the innovations needed to help more efficiently treat cancer and prevent treatment-associated complications,"" said Pedram Razavi, MD, PhD, a breast medical oncologist and physician-scientist at MSK. ""We look forward to collaborating with InsightRX to help clinicians better predict neutropenia and improve outcomes among people receiving chemotherapy.""About InsightRX‍InsightRX is a healthcare technology company that has developed a cloud-based platform for precision medicine and clinical analytics designed to individualize treatment at the point of care.

Continue ReadingInmunidadComunidad_Group_LineupInmunidad Comunidad cuenta con un tema original producido por DJ Ted Smooth, ""King of the Latin Beats"" (""El Rey de los Ritmos Latinos""), el cual fue realizado a través de cuatro videos musicales animados que abordan contenidos sobre la vacuna y la prevención, así como información actualizada acerca del COVID-19 y su desproporcionado impacto en la comunidad latina. Exhibiendo un estilo musical de reguetón, gracias a la fusión de sonidos latinos y ritmos de Hip Hop, Inmunidad Comunidad fue desarrollado para intensificar el combate en contra de la propagación del COVID-19 y sus variantes que han impactado las vidas de millones de latinos en los Estados Unidos, quienes, a pesar de representar 18% de la población, representan 27,5% del total de los casos (según datos del CDC el pasado 10 de septiembre). Aunque esta estadística está por debajo del 34% registrado hace poco más de un año, el resurgir de nuevas variantes y el temor a las vacunas han obligado al Hip Hop Public Health a redoblar sus esfuerzos. Inmunidad Comunidad a su vez está inspirado en ""20 segundos o más"", la revolucionaria campaña desarrollada por HHPH y que cuenta con la participación de Gloria Estefan, Emilio Estefan, Lisa Lisa, Amara La Negra y Melissa Jiménez de ""The Voice"". Las letras corren a cargo del prometedor cantante de rap Leisley y del legendario Dose , quienes aportaron al proyecto sus dinámicos estilos. El asesoramiento médico fue brindado por Olajide Williams (fundador del HHPP y Jefe de Personal del Departamento de Neurología del New York-Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center), junto a la doctora Ana Cepin (Dr. Ana G!) del Columbia University Medical Center. Por su parte, la doctora Monique Hedmann-Maxey, miembro de la junta asesora de HHPH, médica residente del Departamento de Medicina Familiar en el Centro Médico Harbor-UCLA y cantante de rap, participa en el tema como Docta Mo Flow . El video de animación fue ideado, creado y producido por Cartuna y Mylo The Cat. ""Mientras el coronavirus continúa causando estragos en las comunidades de color, la persistente desconfianza que muchos sienten hacia la ciencia médica y la desenfrenada desinformación han demostrado ser incluso un reto mucho más grande, el cual empeora las desigualdades históricas"", dijo el Dr. Olajide Williams. ""Nuestro objetivo con Inmunidad Comunidad es por tanto incrementar los contenidos informativos sobre las vacunas para así demostrar tres puntos factuales de enorme importancia: primero, la vacuna es segura; segundo, ningún atajo científico fue tomado en el desarrollo de la vacuna; y tercero, vacunarse es un acto de servicio comunitario"".""El COVID-19 es la calamidad más devastadora del siglo, y las comunidades negras y mestizas continúan estando desproporcionadamente afectadas"", afirma por su parte la Dra. Ana Cepin. ""Me siento honrada de poder trabajar junto a Hip Hop Public Health mientras nos esforzamos por introducir a Inmunidad Comunidad en la conciencia de la humanidad. Como médica y defensora de la salud, deseo alentar a la población, a mi gente, a aprender y comprender los hechos relacionados con la vacuna y su potencial para lograr que nuestras comunidades vuelvan a ser saludables y fuertes, lo cual propiciará un incremento en la inmunidad para todos nosotros. Inmunidad Comunidad nos ayudará a que esto se consiga"".Cada video gira en torno a un contenido específico relacionado con la vacuna, contenidos que están destinados a disipar mitos populares y desinformaciones. Los temas de los videos incluyen: ¿Qué son las vacunas y cómo funcionan?, ¿Cuáles son los síntomas tras vacunarse?, ¿Por qué vacunarse es mejor que infectarse con el COVID?, y ¿Cuál es el problema con las variantes?""La música es vida y también lo es tener una buena salud"", agregó Lori Rose Benson, directora ejecutiva y CEO de Hip Hop Public Health. ""Las investigaciones demuestran que el arte culturalmente relevante y basado en las comunidades es una fuerza poderosa para el cambio en los comportamientos relacionados con la salud. A lo largo de la pandemia, Hip Hop Public Health ha aplicado nuestro modelo multinivel y multisensorial de educación para la salud basado en evidencias, con el objetivo de divulgar información sobre los comportamientos ligados a la salud, tales como el lavado de manos y el uso de mascarillas que protegen contra el COVID-19, así como el de incrementar el contenido informativo y su alcance en las comunidades de color. Nuestro video musical y educacional, al igual que otros recursos relacionados con la salud pública, la nutrición y los ejercicios físicos, han sido vistos y compartidos por millones de personas alrededor del mundo. Estamos creando un movimiento a través de los propios videos y del mensaje que éstos transmiten, todo diseñado para reemplazar el miedo con hechos"".Además de la canción y del video de Inmunidad Comunidad, HHPH también ha creado múltiples oportunidades para que el público se involucre, se anime a vacunarse y así ayude a detener la propagación del virus. Esto incluirá unas series de reuniones comunitarias virtuales que iniciarán el próximo jueves 7 de octubre a las 7 pm (horario de la costa este). La primera sesión, moderada por el Dr. Max Gómez (reportero médico de los informativos de CBS), ofrecerá ideas y últimas informaciones aportadas por los doctores Williams, Cepin y Hedmann-Maxey. Los encuentros comunitarios de Inmunidad Comunidad abordará la información más compleja en torno a la vacuna para convertirla en mensajes claros, mientras el público tendrá la oportunidad de descubrir cómo Hip Hop Public Health hace uso de la música y del arte con el fin de derribar las barreras comunicacionales.Acerca del Hip Hop Public Health Hip Hop Public Health (HHPH) es una organización reconocida a nivel internacional que diseña e implementa soluciones multimedia y educativas para mejorar la salud pública, propiciar cambios de comportamientos y promover la equidad en la salud.

The company has now raised more than $100 million since its founding.Major global investors in this round include Omega Family Office, Antaeus Enterprises, Inc., The Testa Family Office, Grabe Family Office, The Eduardo Avayu Family Office, and Stephen Eckert, President, The Classic Group, along with investors from other top global family offices, private equity firms, investment banks, and law firms. To accommodate continuing strong investor interest, the company may accept up to an additional $15m in the current round. ""Hemanext is leading a ground-breaking initiative aiming to improve the quality of red blood cells, a critical element of modern medicine, and one of the largest markets in healthcare,"" said Martin Cannon, Co-Founder and CEO of Hemanext. ""We are gratified by the tremendous response we have received from leading private investors in the U.S. and Europe who believe in the potential of our cutting-edge technology which has the potential to improve outcomes for millions of patients worldwide. Our rollout in Europe following receipt of CE Mark certification continues on track, and I am very grateful to our Board, investors, advisors, and, of course, to the extraordinarily talented engineers and physicians driving our progress."" The Potential to Revolutionize Blood Processing and StorageThe processing and storage of blood for transfusion is fundamental to healthcare, and over 90 million units of red blood cells are transfused worldwide annually.1 The innovative Hemanext ONE® RBC Processing and Storage System is a medical device designed to process and store eligible Red Blood Cells [see below for specific CE Marking intended purpose]. The company's aim is to significantly improve the quality of stored red blood cell (RBCs) by limiting oxygen and carbon dioxide levels in the storage environment. Preclinical data has shown that this medical device can maintain RBCs at or below 20% oxygen saturation for up 42 days2, thereby creating hypoxic RBCs. Clinicians believe that limiting oxygen—the main driver of RBC damage—could have a meaningful impact on healthcare outcomes for the 4-5 million American patients transfused annually3. The Hemanext technology has the potential to revolutionize how blood centers approach RBC processing and storage while simultaneously alleviating shortages in the global blood supply.Hemanext strives to provide blood centers with a technology that fosters a decrease in RBC transfusion frequency and a reduction in volume by up to 50%, as shown in preclinical data.4 This reduction has potential to limit associated side effects and the need for therapies to treat them. Hypoxic blood has the potential to benefit millions of patients with chronic conditions requiring ongoing blood transfusions, including thalassemia, sickle cell disease (SCD), and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), as well as patients needing massive transfusions during surgery, trauma, and other medical procedures. Product CE marked for Sale in Europe; Preparation has Begun for Q4 FDA SubmissionOn April 13, 2021, Hemanext announced that it had received CE Mark certification for Hemanext ONE, clearing the way for the innovative medical device to be sold in European markets. Studies are underway to measure the impact of hypoxic RBCs on patient outcomes and the potential cost savings.The company is preparing for a Q4 submission of its FDA application for US market authorization. In the U.S., the Hemanext ONE device remains available for investigational use only. Series A and B Equity RoundsHemanext continues to be in discussions with additional potential A round investors, including institutions, who may close investments before the end of the year. The company expects to launch its B round of financing in the first half of 2022. Sonenshine Fulford Group, a collaboration between Sonenshine Partners in the US and The Fulford Group in the UK, is advising Hemanext in its fund-raising.About HemanextHemanext is a privately held medical technology company based in Lexington, MA that is dedicated to improving the quality, safety, efficacy, and cost of transfusion therapy. The company's research and development efforts center on the study of hypoxically stored red blood cells (RBCs). The company's aim is to significantly improve the quality of stored RBCs by limiting oxygen and carbon dioxide levels in the storage environment.Since its founding in 2008, Hemanext has envisioned a world with fewer and better transfusions. In its early years, multiple grants from the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) enabled the company to demonstrate the feasibility of hypoxic RBC storage, develop its first prototype system, and conduct in vivo research. To date, the company has raised more than $100 million.On April 13, 2021, Hemanext announced that it had received CE Mark certification for Hemanext ONE, clearing the way for the medical device to be sold in European markets. In the EU, the system is CE Marked for the processing and storage CPD/ PAGGSM Red Blood Cells, Leukocytes Reduced (LR RBC) that have been prepared and processed with the HEMANEXT ONE system within 24-hours of collection.

Part of these funds wereMore news about: DroneSeed","DroneSeed","SEATTLE, Sept. 29, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- DroneSeed today announced it has raised $36 million in its Series A funding round. The round was led by Social Capital and Seven Seven Six, with participation from new and existing investors. Part of these funds were used to acquire Silvaseed, a 130-year-old forestry company, to expand DroneSeed's seed collection and seedling cultivation services.A pioneer in climate tech and post-wildfire reforestation, DroneSeed is the only company approved by the FAA to deploy a fleet of heavy-lift drones to reforest after wildfires, enabling healthy forests to grow back. This year, wildfires across the U.S. have already burned nearly six million acres of land, demonstrating the growing need for a full suite of vertically integrated reforestation services like those DroneSeed offers.DroneSeed can drop seed vessels within 30 days after a fire, compared to traditional methods which can take years of waiting to replant. After it reforests burned land, DroneSeed sells the resulting carbon credits to organizations looking to go carbon neutral or negative.""Global reforestation is key to our fight against climate change,"" said Jay Zaveri, a partner at Social Capital. ""We've supported DroneSeed from the very beginning given its promise to terraform our planet for good. Since then, DroneSeed has scaled its effort to reforest land, found a profitable model through carbon markets, and transformed the experience of forest development for landowners.""""DroneSeed is using technology to restore forests faster and help save our planet. Their team's mission-driven approach is what made this investment and partnership a natural fit for Seven Seven Six,"" said Katelin Holloway, Founding Partner at Seven Seven Six who is joining the board as an observer. ""DroneSeed has recruited fantastic talent from diverse communities and disciplines, and we are thrilled to support them as they take on an incredibly important global challenge: climate change.""DroneSeed has expanded Silvaseed, which grows millions of trees per year, to become the largest private seed bank west of Colorado. The acquisition positions DroneSeed as a one-stop-shop for reforestation services including seed collection, seedling cultivation, aerial drone-based seeding, and financing with carbon credits. DroneSeed plans to further expand, doubling its capacity to address increased demand for reforestation services by the middle of next year. ""Recent data has shown that natural forest regeneration is in significant decline due to the size and severity of fires which destroy seed sources. Fire season is expected to only get worse because of climate change,"" said DroneSeed CEO, Grant Canary. ""This funding round, coupled with the acquisition of Silvaseed, enables us to scale up the infrastructure needed for reforestation to meet this skyrocketing demand and customer need. That starts with seed.""In addition to acquiring Silvaseed to expand its seed supply, DroneSeed will use this funding to respond to the 2021 fire season already underway, adding on more reforestation projects, generating carbon credits, and expanding its services geographically in the future.Along with Social Capital and Seven Seven Six, new investors in this raise include DBL Partners, which was an early investor in Tesla and SpaceX; Tobi Lütke, CEO of Shopify; Resilience Reserve; and Marc Benioff's TIME Ventures. Existing investor Spero Ventures also participated with Marc Tarpenning, the co-founder of Tesla, continuing his role as a board observer. More than 60 percent of the capital invested in the round came from investors with a climate and impact fund focus.Additional investors and syndicates include Gaingels with Flight.vc, HBS Lady Angels, Julia Lipton's Awesome People Ventures, and the Coalition angels including Ashley Mayer. Four of nine angel list syndicates are LGBTQ+ or female-led. This round includes continued participation from prior investors Massive, Drone.vc, and Rob Ness Syndicate who have supported the company since DroneSeed completed Techstars Seattle in 2016. About DroneSeed:DroneSeed is scaling reforestation to mitigate the worst effects of climate change. The company is the first and only FAA approved for heavy-lift drone swarms in all states west of Colorado. After its recent acquisition of Silvaseed, DroneSeed is now the first vertically integrated reforestation company in the industry and one of the largest private seed suppliers in the nation. The company is actively developing projects in California, Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Colorado, British Columbia, and Hawaii. DroneSeed's current reforestation customer projects include tribal nations, three of five of the largest timber companies, nonprofits such as The Nature Conservancy, government agencies, and family forests.

""Hanwha's vast financial resources along with its interest in the nutrition business made it a natural choice as a financial ally and strategic partner,"" said Spears. ""With the backing of Hanwha and our other investors, we are well on our way to becoming the largest and most innovative meat company on Earth."" NAM, which was founded in 2018, will use the Series A funding to double the size of its workforce, build a 20,000-square-foot pilot manufacturing facility in Alameda, Calif., and perfect the taste of its first product offering — a variety of sausage products. It will also build out its commercial capabilities to deliver the product in the United States in 2022, pending approval from federal regulators. NAM's production process is designed to scale up quickly to meet demand in rapidly growing markets, such as Asia. ""If the pandemic and climate change has underscored anything, it is that the world needs to find dramatically better ways to satisfy the growing demand by billions of people for protein without harming animals or further hurting the environment,"" said Spears.""We believe our hybrid products, which combine cultured meat with plant-based protein, do just that,"" Spears added. ""And we're moving as quickly as possible to scale up and satisfy the growing demand for affordable meat alternatives around the world."" Prior to this Series A round, New Age Meats raised $7 million of funding, including investment from RXBAR Founder, Peter Rahal. Other investors in the round include Losa Group, Supernode Ventures, Hemisphere Ventures, Level One Fund, Climate Capital, Deep Ventures, Mons Investments, LLC, Innovating Capital, Sand Hill Angels, Marinya Capital, Break Off Capital, Thia Ventures, Kingfisher Capital LLC, and BeniVC.

Creation House consists of a founder-friendly convertible loan of DKK 10M and 18 months incubation at BII with access to labs and office space, business development support, and BII partners. The program allows participants to meet and interact with BII's network of investors, industry partners, alumni and fellow entrepreneurs across its other programs, and is specifically designed to guide companies to a competitive international level and prepare teams for discussions with investors ahead of series A financing rounds. In collaboration with the BII team and their network of experts, companies will make a gap-analysis to find weak spots and roll out a development plan with every step needed to reach the milestones on drug development, good manufacturing practice and regulatory strategy. Bobby Soni, Chief Business Officer, at BioInnovation Institute, commented: ""BII's Creation House program is designed to support start-ups in their journey, and essentially increase the likelihood of success. Through developing the three key pillars: science, team and business, we help each venture to overcome hurdles and position them to attract top quality international investment. We are delighted to have selected this cohort of initiatives, all of which offer the potential to positively impact the lives of patients suffering from conditions of high unmet medical need.""Creation House is for companies with a solid, initial business plan. In the therapeutic area, a cellular proof of concept with chemical or biological tool compounds is required. In bioindustrials, a proof of concept or MVP (minimal viable product) is required and in health tech, a scale-up ready MVP is required. The new companies BII has accepted into the Creation House program are the following:Orbit Health: Harnessing sensor and AI technologies, Orbit provides doctors with continuous and objective insights to enable effective personalized treatment and continuous management of chronic patients at home.iNotify: Focuses on the initial ovarian follicle development to help infertile women who are not benefitting from today's standard hormone treatment.Embark Biotech: A spin-out from the University of Copenhagen with the aim of pioneering novel drugs for metabolic diseases.Pephexia Therapeutics: A biotechnology company working with the discovery and development of innovative peptide-based pharmacotherapies for the effective and convenient treatment of cachexia and related diseases.Since inception in 2018, BII has supported 79 start-ups and projects with EUR 44 million in funding. BII's start-ups have in total raised more than EUR 112 million from local and international investors. Its diverse team brings venture capital, pharma and business expertise together to help early stage companies accelerate to the next level. Recent portfolio / incubated company successes include Adcendo, Stipe Therapeutics, Twelve Bio, Octarine Bio and Chromologics. Details on the companies accepted can be found below:Orbit Health:Harnessing sensor and AI technologies, Orbit Health provides doctors with continuous and objective insights to enable effective personalized treatment and continuous management of chronic patients at home.The Company's first solution, Neptune, is an AI solution that uses only a smartwatch to enable treatment optimization to help people with Parkinson's attain optimal symptom control and restore quality of life. In addition, Orbit Digital Health Lab enables the orchestration of an array of relevant digital health solutions to be applied to a single patient. Orbit brings these solutions from their siloed environment and integrates them into the routine clinical workflow to achieve holistic patient care and real impact.Our vision is to truly enable early intervention and cost-effective management of chronic conditions by offering breakthrough digital health solutions to enable physicians to tailor and optimize care and empower patients to live their best possible life.Webpage link: OrbitiNotify:iNotify focuses on the initial ovarian follicle development to help infertile women who are not benefitting from today's standard hormone treatment. The Company uses first-in-class drug-inducing factors that regulated the intracellular AKT pathway; a major driver of follicle activation and a signal transductive pathway that promotes survival and growth in response to extracellular signals. The Company has identified and validated a compound that activates the AKT pathway in a controlled manner, and thus supports the activation of dormant follicles, a pre-request for fertility.Embark Biotech:Embark Biotech is a spin-out from the University of Copenhagen with the aim of pioneering novel drugs for metabolic diseases. Embark's first program focuses on proprietary agonists to a novel receptor (EMB1), identified by our in-house discovery platform. EMB1 agonists act on adipose cells to absorb and burn sugar and fat, and centrally to reduce food intake. EMB1 has potential in several metabolic diseases, including type 2 diabetes, obesity and genetic forms of obesity such as Prader-Willi Syndrome. The main objective in Embark is to advance the development of an EMB1 agonist within Prader-Willi Syndrome.The largest unmet need for nearly all genetic forms of obesity is the uncontrolled desire to eat (i.e. hyperphagia). Embark seeks to make a breakthrough in this area by introducing a first-in-class drug countering hyperphagia in the most common form of genetic obesity, Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS).PWS is an orphan disease characterized by intense hyperphagia, decreased metabolic rate and progressive weight gain accompanied by an increased risk of severe obesity, diabetes and related complications. Currently, no treatment for PWS hyperphagia exists. Embark has developed agonists for a novel receptor, EMB1, which profoundly decreases food intake and improves metabolic health in hyperphagic mouse models and obese, diabetic non-human primates. We expect that further preclinical development in PWS models will specifically reveal its potential for PWS.Pephexia Therapeutics:Pephexia Therapeutics is a biotechnology company working with the discovery and development of innovative peptide-based pharmacotherapies for the effective and convenient treatment of cachexia and related diseases. Cachexia is defined as un-intended weight loss of at least 5% in 12 months or less. A range of underlying diseases can cause cachexia, most commonly chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cancer, cognitive heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and rheumatoid arthritis. In cancer, cachexia accounts for 20% of the deaths, and in COPD cachexia is associated with 50% reduction in median survival.Link webpage: Perphexia Therapeutics About the BioInnovation Institute FoundationThe BioInnovation Institute Foundation (BII) is an international commercial foundation with a nonprofit objective supported by the Novo Nordisk Foundation.

Every year, 1 in 10 babies are born prematurely - more than 380,000 in the United States. Thanks to advancements in medical care, babies born very prematurely – even before 25 weeks of pregnancy - are more likely to survive today than ever before. The third trimester of pregnancy is the most critical period for a baby's growth and brain development, and many preterm infants spend this entire critical period of growth in the NICU. However, feeding these tiny babies is complex and wrought with challenges for the NICU team.""As seed stage investors focused on technology's ability to put more in the hands of clinicians for the betterment of patients, we can hardly imagine a more lasting impact than that of the lives of babies in the NICU,"" said Jennifer Hartt, Managing Director, Healthcare Investment Group, Ben Franklin Technology Partners of Southeastern PA. ""As an investor who is also a mother who once had a preterm infant in the NICU, I understand what it means to have a fragile baby who we hope grows up to have a meal just be a meal. For these babies, however, every feeding and its composition and timing is of critical importance and they are handling feedings often months before their bodies were designed to do. Astarte Medical is tackling these exact issues with real time tools and analysis. The impacts can be life-long to get this right, with these babies.

Other institutional investors include Coinbase Ventures, Samsung NEXT, Nyca Partners and SCB 10X, with additional funding from all previous investors, among others. This latest round brings a total of $17.7M in funding to Metrika, including its previous $3.7M seed round. The funds will be leveraged to expand the company's platform and broaden its customer base across numerous industries. Metrika customers, which include Algorand, Solana, Dapper Labs (creators of NBA Top Shot), Hedera Hashgraph and Blockdaemon, can track metrics and operations via dashboards, reports and real-time alerts. The result is fast detection of degradations in blockchain network health, management and compliance of operational risk, and intelligent operation interaction. ""As distributed ledgers grow in popularity, operational performance management tools will serve as the critical infrastructure required to support this expanding network,"" said Swaroop ""Kittu"" Kolluri, founder and managing partner at Neotribe Ventures. ""Metrika's elegant architecture fills a critical void in the development, growth and integration of blockchain; we're pleased to support the team in this pursuit.""""Every single business that employs blockchain technology in any application needs to understand the operational risks they are taking in using a distributed application, but the tools to do this didn't exist until Metrika created it,"" said Hans Morris, Managing Partner, Nyca Partners. ""Just like you would never employ a network solution that constantly failed or had security risks for your customers, companies will need to do the same analysis for a distributed network. But how, in fact would you do that? That's what Metrika figured out.The multi-owner, decentralized nature of blockchain technology limits the ability to provide a singular overview of network health and operational status. Traditional monitoring tools are not designed to cope with the design of decentralized networks, presenting a critical issue for stakeholders that require complete operational transparency and insurability.To solve this, Metrika offers blockchain networks (or any company running blockchain applications) the monitoring, analytics and actionable intelligence that provides a comprehensive view for all participants.

Stairwells's unique approach—inside-out security—caught the eye of leading investors, securing $20 million in Series A funding from Sequoia Capital, Accel, Allen & Company LLC. Accel partner Steve Loughlin and Sequoia partner More news about: Stairwell, Inc.","Stairwell, Inc.","SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 21, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Stairwell, a new kind of security company, today introduced Inception, the world's first platform for recursive threat hunting, detection, and response. Inception helps security practitioners decisively and quickly determine if they were compromised—now or in the past—by immediately surfacing threats that typically take months to detect. Stairwells's unique approach—inside-out security—caught the eye of leading investors, securing $20 million in Series A funding from Sequoia Capital, Accel, Allen & Company LLC. Accel partner Steve Loughlin and Sequoia partner Bill Coughran joined the company's board of directors.Stairwell's inside-out approach to security starts by looking inward at a company's data, generating an intelligent view of its environment, and enriching it with emerging threat intelligence to identify artifacts, patterns, and relationships that indicate nefarious activity. By pre-preserving evidence in an organization's environment, Inception removes the time-sensitive nature of detection, and can identify compromises faster by applying new learnings to the past, present and future states of an environment. Stairwell aims to empower security practitioners with an expressive query language that can be applied to threat hunting, detection, and incident response activities simultaneously.According to IBM's Cost of a Data Breach report 2021, the average time it took to identify and contain a breach was 287 days. The SolarWinds attack was a textbook example of the damage that slow detection and response can create. It is estimated that attackers gained unauthorized access to the Orion Platform 14 months before the breach was disclosed and downstream effects began to take place.""We're giving security teams the context and visibility they need so that they can take back the high ground; they don't have to accept defeat as inevitable,"" said Mike Wiacek, founder and CEO of Stairwell. ""We're building Stairwell to help companies outsmart attackers by detecting compromise faster, and in some cases identify novel activity or files that may not be dangerous now, but may become malicious in the future.""""Stairwell has created a different approach to security that enables organizations to get ahead of the most sophisticated attackers,"" said Sequoia's Coughran. ""The Inception platform automates what has traditionally made threat hunting hard, empowering teams with the tools to stop threats in their tracks. We're excited to partner with Mike and see the impact the Stairwell team will have on the market and the industry overall.""The team behind Stairwell is composed of security experts from the likes of Google and Mandiant. Founder and CEO Mike Wiaceck created one of the first threat intelligence teams, Google's Threat Analysis Group, and co-founded Chronicle (now part of Google Cloud). New executive team hires include Mike Wayne as Chief Revenue Officer, Paul Scott as Head of Product, and Steve Miller as Head of Threat Intelligence. Wayne was formerly head of North American security sales at Google Cloud. Before Stairwell, Scott was Director of Threat Research at Perch Security and directed intelligence and research at Alert Logic. Miller held research and data forensic positions at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, FireEye, Anomali, and Mandiant.""The Stairwell team is applying decades of experience working with massive datasets to security, and taking a bold step forward to solve the most serious security challenges that enterprises face on a daily basis,"" said Accel's Loughlin. ""Mike and his leadership team have a strong track record of pushing the industry forward at critical moments in response to the needs of security professionals. They know what's needed, because they were on the front lines while defending adversaries on behalf of the world's most respected companies.""More about InceptionInception speeds compromise detection by empowering teams with recursive contextual threat analysis, detection, and response. Key benefits include:Detects compromise across past, present, and future statesInception treats all files as suspicious and pre-preserves them as evidence to speed up detection and uncover previously unknown compromises. By continuously evaluating the entirety of evidence in light of emerging insights, it unlocks time—detecting compromise across the past, present, and future states of an organization's environment, and denying attackers the advantages on which they depend.Produces contextual threat intelligenceWith its inside-out approach, Inception uncovers what's most important to an organization. The platform starts by analyzing an organization's files to produce intelligence and then enriches it with external information to deliver actionable insights for intelligence and response teams.Keeps organizations out of attackers' reachInception helps organizations outsmart even the most sophisticated attackers with threat detection that is unique to each organization and imperceptible to attackers. It does this by giving organizations tailored defenses and intelligence that attackers can't test against or reverse-engineer.About StairwellStairwell helps organizations take back the cybersecurity high ground with solutions that attackers can't evade. The Inception platform is built to help security teams outsmart any attacker, empowering them with recursive contextual threat analysis, detection, and response to detect compromise faster. By removing the time sensitive nature of threat detection and starting inside out, Inception unlocks time and creates tailored, constantly adapting defenses.

Existing Seed investorsMore news about: Intenseye","Intenseye","NEW YORK and ISTANBUL, Sept. 21, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Intenseye, the AI-powered employee health and safety (EHS) company, announced a $25 million Series A investment led by New York-based global venture capital and private equity firm Insight Partners. Existing Seed investors Point Nine and Air Street Capital invested significantly in the round and were joined by Alex Dalyac, CEO of insurance computer vision unicorn, Tractable. With the funding, Intenseye will further expand its go-to-market strategy and build on its existing customer base of international manufacturers. At the time of the investment, Intenseye's product is currently deployed across more than 40 cities around the world for leading global industrial groups and Fortune 500 companies in the US, Europe and Asia. Intenseye's software captures workplace safety incidents, such as unsafe acts and near misses, in real-time without compromising the worker's anonymity and privacy. The system can be remotely deployed by integrating into existing cameras within customer facilities. By making use of computer vision models and millions of hours of real-world customer data, Intenseye processes live video streams to rapidly identify over 35 unsafe act types. Then, if incidents occur, EHS professionals receive real-time alerts through the platform, by email, or SMS messages to allow for an efficient and effective response. As physical environments change and new risks emerge, Intenseye's AI-powered system learns to adapt and keep workers safe. Sercan Esen, CEO of Intenseye says:""The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that one worker died every 99 minutes from a work-related injury in 2019. Our mission at Intenseye is to provide an anonymous solution that will help significantly decrease the death and injury rates in the workplace until they both reach zero. We want to continue bringing awareness to the safety of workers in the workplace, create a safer work environment for everyone, and be the eyes of what could have been previously unseen.""Until now, EHS teams have relied upon manual, employee-led procedures to identify safe and unsafe acts happening in the workplace. This involves individuals taking time away from their current roles to walk the shop floor in an attempt to identify unsafe acts as they happen. Instead of these manual inspections, Intenseye introduces a new software-driven paradigm for EHS professionals in which their work is augmented by privacy-preserving computer vision running on existing facility cameras that are configured to run 24/7 EHS inspections. Teddie Wardi, Managing Director at Insight Partners says:""At Insight, we have a strong track record of investing in innovative, data-driven software companies who harness the power of data and AI to improve physical, real-world outcomes.

Floating Point, Ridgeline Partners, and existing investors Amadeus Capital Partners and Schematic Ventures joined the round, which closed in May 2021.Trade wars, the rise of e-commerce, covid supply chain shocks, and sustainability concerns are driving fundamental changes to supply chain networks and global trade flows.

The round was led by Boston-based OpenView Partners, a VC that exclusively invests in product-led SaaS B2B companies. OpenView joined other participating investors such as Matrix Partners, who previously led the Series A.Kolide is betting big on a user-focused approach to endpoint security. Unlike other endpoint security products which ignore users and only alert the security team, Kolide's SaaS product enlists the help of employees directly to fix serious issues it detects on Linux, Mac, and Windows devices. All communication happens over a Slack app that messages end-users when their device no longer meets the security standards set by the company. The messages include customized instructions and even a way for end-users to immediately verify they correctly fixed the problem. This combination of high quality cross-platform visibility and end-user involvement enables Kolide to fix issues that cannot be resolved with traditional endpoint security and management software. For example, customers can use Kolide to remind employees to remove sensitive data after it has been lingering for a little too long on their local drive.""With Kolide, Glassdoor receives a wealth of information about our endpoint fleet, helping us understand the 'who, what, and why' of all of our user systems,"" says Jason Broccoardo, Lead Systems Engineer at Glassdoor. ""Whether it's used by IT staff assisting users or as part of various security compliance efforts, we are getting the answers we need about our endpoint deployments and are able to extend this knowledge beyond IT through the use of checks and the Privacy Center, which empowers our users to know more about the state of their machine and assist in the care and maintenance of the device,"" says Broccoardo. Kolide's surge of growth stemmed from the mass-migration towards remote-work, and the logistical and visibility challenges which accompany that shift.""Remote-first has created two new opposing forces. On one hand, IT and Security teams feel they need more visibility and greater control over devices out of their physical reach,"" says Jason Meller, CEO & Founder at Kolide. ""On the other hand, employees, now at home, are starting to worry about being inappropriately surveilled, in turn driving them to use unauthorized personal devices for their work,"" says Meller. ""The key to solving both sides of the problem is total transparency. It's why Kolide uses an open source endpoint agent and why we've invested hundreds of hours creating the best possible experience for end-users to see exactly what data from devices is being collected and who in the company can see it. These are novel concepts for our industry but with Kolide, we are giving end-users, IT and Security teams a hopeful future.""Last year, Kolide codified its open and transparent approach in a manifesto written by the CEO called, ""Honest Security"". The free guide offers unique approaches to solve novel ethical and privacy challenges associated with endpoint monitoring, and simultaneously rails against an enterprise security industry which increasingly views users as threats instead of allies. The guide has attracted fast-growing organizations who have been dissatisfied with traditional endpoint security approaches. A recent survey conducted by Kolide concluded that 44% of responding companies believe they can still improve their implementation of Honest Security while 71% think they could benefit moderately or higher by implementing more Honest Security's recommendations. ""Honest Security is so well aligned with 1Password's values, I wish we had written it. After seeing Kolide's approach to security and their product, we knew it was the right solution for 1Password,"" says Harlie Hardage, Senior Security Specialist at 1Password. ""At OV, our mission is to improve people's working lives,"" says General Partner Ricky Pelletier. ""Kolide's Honest Security approach is reshaping the way IT and security teams deploy security and compliance software. Now more than ever, companies are emphasizing, valuing and satisfying their employees. We are seeing consent based IT solutions as necessary to attract the next generation of employees.""This latest funding round will go towards fueling the growth and expansion of Kolide's go-to market strategy, and hiring additional engineers and product staff to expand the product's capabilities. Since its original launch, Kolide has been operating with a lean team to scale their product to 250+ customers.About Kolide Kolide's flagship SaaS product was built from the ground up to enable organizations toachieve their security and compliance goals by practicing the tenants of Honest Security.Instead of locking down devices, Kolide enables teams to communicate their organization's security recommendations on Slack so they are most impactful to an end-user. Over 250 customers proudly use Kolide today to secure devices via Slack providing millions of customized security and compliance recommendations for their Linux, Mac, and Windows devices.

The result is slower shipments, higher prices and unhappy customers.The pandemic exacerbated this problem, as e-commerce boomed, further straining supply chains. Global e-commerce is set to surpass $5 trillion in 2021, while B2B online commerce is expected to reach $20.9 trillion by 2027.

Critical to these measurements is that the results can be delivered in a timely manner so that adjustments can be achieved by the next dosing cycle.As part of this partnership, busulfan concentration levels generated from Saladax's assay technology are interpreted using the InsightRX precision dosing platform to improve exposure target attainment while decreasing safety risks to patients receiving the chemotherapy drug.""For a number of reasons, measuring busulfan is a challenging process,"" said Salvatore J. Salamone, PhD, President and CEO of Saladax. ""We've created an assay that can make it much easier to obtain rapid measurements of busulfan in patients. Our technology, coupled with the InsightRX precision dosing platform, which simplifies manual and highly-specialized processes, provides rapid and accurate results that will help clinicians select an optimal dose of Busulfan.""The combination of an automated assay coupled with the InsightRX tool will allow for testing and analysis in a routing clinical laboratory. Centers will no longer have to send out the samples for analysis, will be able to test at their own institution and have results in hours instead of days.""We are proud to partner with Saladax and we look forward to presenting the joint solution at an international forum with them,"" said Sirj Goswami, PhD, CEO and co-founder of InsightRX. ""The ability to both measure and interpret results accurately can lead to better care improvement while reducing adverse drug events. This is particularly important for life-saving drugs that come with potential side effects, including patient safety and potential harm.""In addition to launching the combined solution, InsightRX and Saladax will also be presenting several research initiatives at IATDMCT. Saladax will be presenting validation results on the MyCare™ Oncology Busulfan Assay kit, which will highlight the accuracy and precision in more than 230 patients. InsightRX will also be presenting their latest contributions to the precision dosing field with a talk titled: ""Boosting Model-Informed Precision Dosing with Machine Learning: Improving predictions in atypical patients,"" which highlights how machine learning can be used to selectively flatten model-priors during traditional pharmacometric approaches, improving model-informed precision dosing in outlier patients.Saladax and InsightRX will be presenting their findings at the Congress in Rome, Italy. This marks the latest foray into Europe for InsightRX, which recently announced that it is expanding its presence on the continent with its CE mark, now approved in six countries. Additionally, InsightRX has a commercial contract to use its precision dosing platform with an academic medical center in the Netherlands.About Saladax Biomedical, Inc.Headquartered in Bethlehem, PA, Saladax Biomedical, Inc. is a privately held company that develops, manufactures, and markets assays that provide rapid therapeutic drug levels for essential and life-saving medicines prescribed by psychiatrists and oncologists.

Ginkgo, which recently announced a business combination with Soaring Eagle Acquisition Corp. (Nasdaq: SRNG), has successfully launched several new companies across a variety of end-markets, bringing together funding from strategic and financial investors. The Ferment Consortium, a company creation studio that works with Viking Global Investors and Cascade Investment, both of whom are providing capital to Verb, was created to help ideate and launch new companies that use cell programming to support human and environmental health and well-being.The probiotics category is a $50B global industry that's growing rapidly. As awareness and understanding of the microbiome—the trillions of bacteria that live in the human body—has grown over the past decade, there has been tremendous interest in probiotic enhanced foods, beverages and supplement products as part of lifestyle regimens that reduce chronic disease and improve wellness. These products have used strains of bacteria common to yogurt and other fermented products. However, there are a number of product development challenges involved, including limited shelf life and stability, and the need to identify strains with more specific metabolic profiles. ""The probiotics industry has been in an era of partial understanding that has struggled with a need for more mechanistic understanding of how probiotics impact health,"" said Mike Bush, Verb advisor and Executive Board Member of the International Probiotics Association. ""Ginkgo has a suite of robust tools that will enable this new company to transform the paradigm for probiotics in the supplement and food markets.""""Verb will be using microbes as a way to deliver beneficial molecules into the gut or to 'bio-transform' food substrates into substances our body needs. People are not getting what they can from their food and, for a variety of reasons, we absorb a fraction of the available nutrients in our diet,"" said Todd Beckman, Verb advisor and former founder of probiotic company Goodbelly Probiotics. ""Gut microbiome science repeatedly points to the population of microbes in the gut as a major actor in many aspects of wellness, from actual ability to extract nutrients, to secreting neurotransmitters that affect mood, satiety/obesity, immune system function and more.""Ginkgo has significant expertise in the discovery and design of microbes for a wide array of functions. Verb Biotics plans to leverage Ginkgo's high-throughput platform to perform sequencing, proteomics and metabolomics analysis, pathway design, cell culturing, and fermentation to improve the design and development of probiotics.

The funding injection will enable Neuroglee to launch first-of-their-kind virtual neurology clinics for patients diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment related to difficult-to-treat conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, while also advancing the company's DTx pipeline.Openspace Ventures led the round with participation from EDBI as well as existing investors who have built transformational healthcare businesses, including Raman Singh, ex-CEO of Mundipharma, Biofourmis co-founders Kuldeep Singh Rajput and Wendou Niu, and a leading pharmaceutical company, Eisai Co., which is a strategic shareholder in the company.""Neuroglee's solution has tremendous potential to meaningfully benefit global patients as they and their families bravely combat the progression of neurodegenerative disease"", said Openspace co-founder Shane Chesson. ""As signaled by our prior investment in Biofourmis, we recognized at an early point that digital health will be an essential piece of the puzzle for providers and caregivers to fight difficult-to-treat health conditions. Neuroglee's early leadership role in their space has truly impressed us.""Neuroglee's technology includes solutions for both care-at-home and for DTx, in which physicians prescribe the digital therapy the same way as a prescription drug. Aniket Singh Rajput, founder and CEO of Neuroglee, said: ""This funding will be instrumental in facilitating the continued development of Neuroglee's digital therapeutics and virtual clinical services that combine best-in-class cognitive rehabilitation strategies and remote care management to help delay or slow the worsening of symptoms in patients with mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease.""Filling a Critical Market Need for a Difficult-to-Treat ConditionNeuroglee's adaptive learning platform uses machine learning and several novel digital biomarkers to dynamically personalize treatment to each patient's cognitive and physical needs. Treatment includes both therapeutic interventions and evidence-based lifestyle and cognitive behavior therapies tied to cognitive function, mood and behavior.Currently, 5.7 million Americans and 50 million people worldwide are living with Alzheimer's disease. Neuroglee CEO Rajput says that the company's initial focus on mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's—the most common cause of dementia—fills a huge market need, given that there is no known cure and only a handful of FDA-approved medications to treat the condition. Alzheimer's disease progressively impacts a person's memory, judgment, language and independence. Collaboration with Mayo ClinicNeuroglee and Mayo Clinic are co-developing Neuroglee ConnectTM, a novel clinical care program that will be based on Mayo Clinic's Healthy Action to Benefit Independence & Thinking® (HABIT). HABIT is a 10-day in-person program to provide patients and their families with state-of-the-art, evidence-based lifestyle and behavioral treatments for MCI.Neuroglee ConnectTM will combine the evidence-based HABIT program and Neuroglee's adaptive learning platform to create personalized, real-time responsiveness and interventions in managing patients in the comfort of their homes. Patients are supported by round-the-clock health navigators and clinical care teams for near real-time assessment and interventions. ""With care expanding outside of the hospital and into the home, Neuroglee is assuring the management of neurodegenerative diseases is a simple, empowering, everyday event for patients,"" Rajput said. ""Actionable data and virtual clinical support will give more patients access to world-class care, no matter where they are.""Boston to Become New HQs Due to Area's Digital Health InnovationIn addition to the funding round, Neuroglee has announced plans to establish its new headquarters in downtown Boston in the fourth quarter of 2021, where the company will focus on building and scaling engineering, clinical operations and commercial teams. ""We knew Boston was the right place for us because it's one of the largest hubs of digital health innovation and investment in the world, given the leading healthcare provider organizations, research institutions and technology centers in the area,"" Rajput said. ""This will expand our global footprint, adding to our growing regional management and technology development teams in Singapore and India.About Neuroglee Neuroglee Therapeutics discovers, develops and commercializes personalized evidence-based digital therapeutics (DTx) and virtual care solutions to treat and manage patients with neurodegenerative diseases. The company also is breaking new ground by offering first-of-their-kind virtual specialty care clinics for patients diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment related to difficult-to-treat conditions such as Alzheimer's disease.

With tools for demographic targeting, advertising attribution, and brand safety, RAP allows brands and their agencies to establish a foothold in podcast marketing or scale their existing spend. RAP also takes the overwhelming operational overhead of executing podcast advertising campaigns out of the equation, allowing sophisticated, performance-minded marketers to point-and-click to create a campaign in a data-rich, self-service environment, similar to that of Facebook and Google. Hundreds of advertisers are already taking advantage of RedCircle's inventory and are on pace to spend several million dollars in 2021. The majority of the revenue is distributed to the podcasters, supporting their creative work.Many podcasters take advantage of the RedCircle Exclusive Content product, a cross-platform paywall that lets creators restrict bonus episodes to paying subscribers only. Podcasters can therefore build their subscription business and understand its growth in the exact same platform where they view audience analytics. Using Exclusive Content, RedCircle's podcasters have amassed tens of thousands of paying subscribers, and many are generating six figures annually as a result. By bringing powerful tools to independent podcasters, RedCircle has been growing at an exponential rate since its inception in 2018, with thousands of monthly active podcasters earning several million dollars this year alone. With this new Series A funding, RedCircle plans to expand its team and enhance its offerings so that more podcasters can earn what they deserve. ""We've seen how software tools can empower independents against incumbents, like with Shopify and Amazon,"" says Nick Efstratis, managing partner of EPIC Ventures, one of the investment round's leads. ""Considering the strength of the RedCircle team and their traction thus far, I'm confident that they can stand up to the big names in podcasting and ensure that podcasting revenue and resources become accessible to all.""About RedCircleFounded in 2018 by Mike Kadin and Jeremy Lermitte, RedCircle provides a platform for podcasts and brands to scale their message. The platform helps podcasters with distribution, growth, and monetization, and its advertising platform helps brands purchase advertising efficiently, guaranteeing high ROI.

The company has demonstrated hyper-growth in Q2'21, growing its total portfolioMore news about: PayEm","PayEm","NEW YORK, Sept. 1, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- PayEm, the global spend and procurement platform for high-growth and multinational organizations today announces $27M in funding. The $27M consists of a $7M seed funding round led by Pitango First and NFX with participation by LocalGlobe and Fresh Fund, followed by a $20M Series A led by Glilot+, the early growth fund of Glilot Capital Partners. The company has demonstrated hyper-growth in Q2'21, growing its total portfolio value by 4x, generating millions of dollars in revenue.PayEm's platform automates finance processes from request to reconciliation, giving individuals and teams within global organizations the ability to manage non-payroll spend as needed while safeguarding budget, automating manual accounting tasks, and allowing finance teams to remain agile and in control. Until recently, most major spend decisions were made by the procurement and finance teams. Today, however, decision-making with regards to vendors, SaaS platforms and more are delegated to teams throughout the organization. This paradigm shift has created additional complexities for finance teams that need to keep track of thousands of small transactions using outdated technology, often handling much of the work manually. At the same time, Nilson Report estimates that annual B2B payment volume presently sits at $127 trillion and is expected to reach $200 trillion by 2028. PayEm has developed a platform that allows companies to integrate their financial systems and ERP with an advanced end-to-end customized request-to-approval workflow and payment solution. Specifically designed for global SMEs and enterprises, the platform offers control and transparency by streamlining reimbursement, procurement, AP automation, and credit card processes into corporate spending. Global finance teams specifically have an additional layer of complexity: their local subsidiaries work in silos, use local banks and location-specific financial services. This creates even more manual work and a fragmented workflow. PayEm's platform was built for national and multinational operations: with just a mouse click, one can define the default currency used for each subsidiary. The platform allows every subsidiary to have financial and accounting autonomy while enabling holistic processes at the global level. The technology also has cross-border capabilities: finance teams using PayEm can send funds to over 200 territories in 130 different currencies in just one click. Companies such as Fiverr, Jfrog, Next Insurance, and hundreds more have already adopted PayEm to manage their international and local spend. ""We are delighted with the work that we have done so far with PayEm, it has saved days of manual work each month using their platform and automating our reconciliation processes,"" says Or Hecht, Procurement Manager at Fiverr. ""We built PayEm specifically to meet the needs of SMEs and enterprises. Between the rise of SaaS, the trend of hybrid work, and the acceleration of global expansion by companies as they tap into markets and talent pools, our platform enables employees and various departments to make their own spending decisions while offering centralized control and visibility for finance teams,"" said Itamar Jobani, CEO and Co-Founder of PayEm. ""By using our product, finance teams can manage every aspect of non-payroll expenditures, including credit cards, in a SOX-compliant way, and support multi-currencies and different accounting methods across multi-territories, while eliminating manual overhead on reconciliation.""Yair Cassuto, Partner at Pitango First: ""We're seeing a substantial struggle for finance and procurement teams. Current systems and processes were not built for this paradigm shift in how budgets are spent and managed. PayEm enables companies to run agile distributed processes across teams, geographies and spend categories in a controlled, compliant and centralized manner. PayEm's market acceptance was very apparent with every introduction we've made during and after our investment process and we were astonished by the pace of adoption of PayEm's solution.""Lior Litwak, Managing Partner at Glilot Capital and Head of Glilot+, said: ""PayEm is solving a fundamental problem for enterprises - the ongoing fragmentation in financial tools despite decades of innovation in expense management, approval flows, employee reimbursement, procurement and other corporate financial processes. PayEm offers a holistic spend management and procurement platform for corporates that serves and delights both employees, their managers, and financial officers, as demonstrated by the company's tremendous recent growth. We are excited to join Itamar, Omer and the rest of the PayEm team as they continue to build the ideal end-to-end spend and procurement platform - a true financial operating system for modern businesses."" Gigi Levy Weiss, General Partner at NFX, added: ""PayEm has built an outstanding product which is already in use by many multinational companies. We believe that any company can benefit from the PayEm product and as such see almost unlimited potential. The very fast growth to date is a credit to not only the leadership of Itamar and Omer, but to the phenomenal team of developers and finance experts they've brought together. We are super excited about the company!""About PayEmPayEm's global spend and procurement platform brings control, transparency and automation to finance teams. The technology captures requests, invoices, creates bills, schedules and sends payments to anywhere in the world, in any currency, auto-categorizes and syncs with an ERP; PayEm automates tedious tasks, reduces frictions and frustration, giving finance teams precious time to focus on the big picture while giving them real-time visibility by department, team, employee, subsidiary, or vendor in reporting and automation.PayEm was founded in 2019 by Itamar Jobani, CEO, and Omer Rimoch, CTO, and is headquartered in Tel Aviv, Israel.

Coming off the momentum of a sizable series A, the tech company recently reported over 225,000 on-platform automated shipments in one month, up from 65,000 automated shipments at the same timeMore news about: MyCarrier","MyCarrier","SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., Aug. 26, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- MyCarrier, a shipping management platform, is experiencing growth that continues to exceed industry expectations. Coming off the momentum of a sizable series A, the tech company recently reported over 225,000 on-platform automated shipments in one month, up from 65,000 automated shipments at the same time last year. The company currently has over 24K registered platform shippers.Founded in 2017, the MyCarrier platform allows shippers to directly connect with major carriers, compare negotiated rates, view transit times on a given lane, and electronically tender loads. Calendar views make load planning easier and extensive API integrations automate exception-based shipment tracking. Additionally, MyCarrier's document flow automates the entire settle for end-to-end frictionless shipping. MyCarrier's rapid growth has taken the Scottsdale, AZ company from 28 full-time employees in a 4,000 SQFT office in 2020, to over 100 employees by year end in a sprawling 20,000+ SQFT complex. In fact, Phoenix Business Journal recently named MyCarrier as one of the fastest growing technology companies in Arizona. According to MyCarrier co-founder, president, and COO Chris Scheid, this rapid expansion is only the beginning.""White label partnerships with industry leading companies like Saia Freight, Old Dominion, and Averitt Express are allowing us to provide shipping solutions to more customers than ever before,"" Scheid said. ""As we work with our partners, we're able to continually advance our technology and provide an even better experience for shippers."" Along with substantial investor interest and a notable growth in profits, the young company has attracted top executive talent, including industry freight veteran and former project44 President, Tommy Barnes.Barnes, who accepted the role of CRO because of his confidence in the company's vision and mission, believes MyCarrier offers a solution for both shippers and carriers that can't be found anywhere else in the industry. ""I've been in the industry a long time, and I recognize that there's nothing out there like MyCarrier,"" Barnes said. ""MyCarrier's distribution model democratizes the shipping process and sets it apart from other freight tech companies. Removing the middleman and giving shippers direct access to their carriers is certainly a game-changer, especially in a tight capacity market."" Additionally, this platform will service the shipper community with a dynamic multi-modal shipping solution that cannot be rivaled by any other organization.Saia's Vice President of Sales, Mark Hamblin, agrees with Barnes. ""As a white label MyCarrier partner, we have seen significant success with the platform,"" Hamblin said. ""The API technology drives network efficiencies and enhances visibility, both for ourselves and our customers.""Along with the prominent hire of Tommy Barnes as CRO, MyCarrier recently brought on strategic business leader, Rich Gibsen, as VP of Product Management. Gibsen, who has over 20 years of experience managing SaaS products, has provided product-related solutions for both large enterprises and high growth start-ups. Gibsen's success with scaling SaaS companies makes him a solid fit for MyCarrier's rapid, yet sustainable growth strategy. Another outward sign of the company's growth is the successful release of innovative new features such as QuickShip, an adaptive learning technology that allows shippers to dispatch hundreds of orders in minutes. Other highly anticipated products, such as a dynamic truckload, are in the works and expected to be officially announced soon. Based on feedback from thousands of shippers and carriers, this upcoming feature is expected to bring best-in-class shipment automation to truckload. MyCarrier CEO and co-founder, Mike Bookout, plans to continue offering new features within the platform that create a better multimodal shipping experience, and to work with shippers and carriers to provide solutions in an ever-changing market.""The advantage of working with each carrier individually is that it allows us to gather their technological requirements to make the platform better meet their needs,"" Bookout said. ""The same goes for shippers. Each of our new products and features are designed to provide our customers with a simpler, more cost-effective way to ship."" Bookout predicts that MyCarrier's rapid growth will continue to accelerate over the next few years. ""The growing demand in the carrier-direct marketplace, along with projections for a booming LTL market, creates the opportunity for sustained company growth,"" Bookout said. ""In fact, Chris [Scheid] and I predict that MyCarrier will become a billion-dollar company within 5 years, and possibly even sooner.""

The round was led by Silverton Partners with participation by M13 Ventures and Crosscut Ventures.Continue ReadingAllVoicesAllVoices will use the funds to provide its customers, including companies like Zillow, Box, and GoPro, with more channels of communication with employees, scale its platform for leaders to resolve issues both individually and systemically, build additional automated solutions, and expand the team to meet the needs of the company's increasingly large enterprise customers.Company leaders using the platform today are seeing fewer blind spots within their organizations as employees feel safer to speak up about issues using AllVoices. The platform provides companies with data on where and how issues are arising and tools to address these issues at scale using best practices and automation. People leaders with data-driven resources will be best equipped to resolve issues and improve employee satisfaction.""Today, more than ever, companies are finding it more challenging to recruit and retain talent because of shifts in the labor market,"" said Claire Schmidt, CEO and founder of AllVoices. ""Real-time employee feedback is critical to help companies proactively address workplace issues. When internal channels for this type of feedback are not available, employees have to take more extreme action. For example, the recent walkout of Activision Blizzard employees, the Amazon employee petition alleging discrimination and harassment, and Governor Andrew Cuomo's resignation over sexual harassment claims all show what happens when companies or organizations do not provide safe and effective channels for employees to speak up.""In fact, 74% of employees would be more likely to give feedback if they believed it was truly anonymous. That cohort jumps to 85% when reporting harassment, according to the AllVoices State of Workplace Harassment 2021 Report. Both groups cited fears of retaliation and job loss as the main reasons they would hesitate to report. The research also found that working from home does not stop workplace harassment, as nearly 40% report they still experience harassment remotely through email, video conferencing, chat apps or by phone. ""Silverton had been doing research into the employee feedback space for some time,"" said Roger Chen, Partner at Silverton Partners. ""We identified AllVoices as a market leader and reached out to Claire even though they were not seeking funding at the time. We see the immense value in providing companies a way to collect and manage feedback that builds trust with their employees."" ""There is a major gap in reporting options for employees and a lack of tools companies can use to solicit, track, and resolve employee feedback,"" said Schmidt. ""Our goal is to create safer, more inclusive companies and, with the support of Silverton and M13 and the continued support of Crosscut, we are excited to be able to scale our team to meet the growing demand for employee feedback management platforms like ours.""About AllVoicesAllVoices is a leader in the employee feedback management category, providing employees with a completely safe, anonymous way to report issues directly to company leaders. With 74% of employees citing they would be more likely to report workplace issues if they knew their feedback would be completely anonymous, AllVoices empowers employees to report and companies to take action proactively. As a third-party encrypted platform, AllVoices is the next generation in employee feedback management.

A pioneer in artificial intelligence, wherEX makes B2B commerce transparent and increases competition by bringing multiple qualified offers for every product or service tendered in its marketplace. The startup originated in 2016 with its first clients in the salmon industry and then expanded to other sectors to solve the common pain in digitizing procurement processes and bringing competitive sourcing for all company purchases. As of May 2021, the company is trading around $720 M USD through its platform between 125 enterprise clients and more than 20,000 suppliers both local and global. ""By year-end we should grow our transaction volumes by 300% and end with 250 enterprise clients across LatAm."" – Juan Carlos Hurtado.The round was led by Kayyak Ventures with FJ Labs, Jaguar Ventures and Tuesday Capital participating. In this round, the startup incorporated two more co-founders Ben Garcia and Francisco Puente who are Y-Combinator alumni class of S20 and are serial entrepreneurs ever since graduating from MIT in 2018. With this capital injection and team growth the company plans to continue its international expansion in LatAm and compete in the US Market by 2022. The US Market dimension by itself has around 60,000 prospective clients which is similar in size to LatAm. ""B2B commerce in the US is still in its infancy in terms of digital, financing and sourcing. We see an opportunity to bring a comprehensive and analytical e-sourcing solution to the US Market to make B2B transactions easy."" – says Cristobal Silva, managing Partner at Kayyak Ventures.Challenges for Procurement Teams During PandemicDuring the pandemic the company has grown its traded volume and customer base by 220%. During COVID-19, entire supply chains were disrupted bringing new challenges to procurement teams accustomed to using their usual suppliers. Now in 2021, many materials continue to be scarce leading to abrupt increases in price. As an example, price of timber in the US driven by construction demand and supply shortage increased 288% in the US[1]. In Mexico price of steel has increased 200%, bringing severe challenges to the entire steel industry[2]. This scarcity has driven the need for a digital sourcing platform that plays at both a local and global level. In addition, procurement teams and suppliers sellers working remotely face new challenges in digital transformation. According to Mckinsey report[3], 49% of procurement teams report their productivity to be falling in remote work and 46% of them have reduced their cost reduction targets in 2021. It is now more important than ever to bring procurement practices to the digital age to improve transparency and communication between buyers and suppliers. About WherexWherEX is an e-sourcing enterprise software for request for proposals and requests for information. The startup was born in the fishing industry and soon expanded to cover other verticals in industrials, materials and services. Through its digital tool, wherEX offers a solution to request products and services and receive bids from qualified suppliers across the globe. This practice brings competition and transparency to every purchase and allows suppliers the opportunity to bid through the platform to potential buyers. Lastly, this cloud based software is quick to implement and easy to adopt for companies bringing the best return in investment in the market.

Craft Ventures led the round with participation from returning investors Abstract Ventures,More news about: TrustLayer","TrustLayer","SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 18, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- TrustLayer, a collaborative risk management platform, today announced it has closed a Series A funding round of $15.1 million. Craft Ventures led the round with participation from returning investors Abstract Ventures, Box Group, Propel Venture Partners, NFP Ventures, Sure Ventures, and new investor PruVen Capital. As part of the funding round, Brian Murray, Partner and COO at Craft Ventures, will join TrustLayer's Board of Directors.In just two years, TrustLayer has established itself as the preferred solution to replace the insurance industry's antiquated, paper-based methods for verifying coverage, which introduce significant risk to supplier-driven sectors such as construction, banking, property management, and sports entertainment. TrustLayer is backed by 20 of the top 100 leading brokerages, including the Graham Company, Holmes Murphy, Heffernan Insurance Brokers, M3, and BrokerTech Ventures.Solving major pain point for millions of businesses, insurtech TrustLayer earns validation from top venture funds.Tweet thisResearch shows that 75 percent of U.S. businesses are underinsured. In addition to risk, the current process is costly for insurers and the companies requesting verification: 200,000 proof of coverage requests are made daily in the U.S., causing significant resource strain and administrative cost. TrustLayer uses robotic process automation (RPA) and AI to automate this process securely, so companies can automatically verify the insurance and licenses of their vendors, suppliers, borrowers, and tenants.Following several successful pilots in 2020, leading insurance brokers both invested in the company and elected to become sales channel partners, reselling the service to their own customers. BrokerTech Ventures, a group made up of 13 of the most innovative insurance agencies in the U.S. and 11 top-tier insurance companies, made TrustLayer their first investment in a company that completed their accelerator program. TrustLayer is the only solution with this level of industry support.""It's clear that verification of insurance and business credentials is a pain point for millions of businesses, which is why we have seen such enthusiastic support for TrustLayer's secure, automated solution,"" said John Fohr, co-founder and CEO of TrustLayer. ""We are especially proud to have such significant backing from a top-tier SaaS fund like Craft Ventures as well as some of the top insurance brokers in the country, a tremendous industry validation for our technology. We look forward to continuing this momentum with the support of our investors."" The Series A financing comes after an impressive year for TrustLayer that included considerable growth in industries such as construction, property management, sports, and hospitality. The company is actively hiring top talent across its sales, marketing, and engineering teams to support the high demand for its solution. The new capital will also fuel the development of its live digital proof of coverage solution, and integrations with many insurance carrier systems of record, building upon pilots with major carriers such as Liberty Mutual, and Nationwide. TrustLayer's real-time digital certificate will unlock even more value, enabling brokers to more easily sell the right policy to vendors with inadequate coverage and helping insurance carriers more accurately assess potential risks.""Insurance helps mitigate risk. For businesses, insurance plays a critical role in the durability of its operations. The problem is no one is exactly sure who's covered and by how much -- we're still swapping poorly scanned PDFs and faxes to prove outdated coverage,"" said Brian Murray, Partner and COO at Craft Ventures. ""TrustLayer fixes this. Their technology automates the collection and verification of insurance, helping companies and their partners accurately assess risk and avoid business interruption.""Over the past year, TrustLayer has announced significant partnerships with associations and broker partners, including a recent partnership with Graham Company, one of the country's largest insurance brokers and employee benefits consultants, and with Procore.About TrustLayer TrustLayer is an AI-powered collaborative risk management platform working to digitize the highly manual, error-prone, and paper-based process of insurance verification. With TrustLayer, companies can securely automate the verification of insurance, licenses, and compliance documents of their business partners (i.e., vendors, subcontractors, suppliers, borrowers, tenants, ridesharing, and franchisees) in an easy-to-use digital dashboard.

PHOTO CREDIT: IPG-DXTRA""Children as young as four years old show signs of racial bias and racism, but we've also seen young children act as advocates for fairness, or equity,"" said Dr. Ronda Taylor Bullock, executive curator of WE ARE, an anti-racism education organization that runs camps and workshops for children, parents and educators. ""Teaching children to recognize and resist racism early are critical first steps to raising an anti-racist generation.""For generations, Black and Brown parents have discussed racism with their children as a means of preparing them to deal with the racism they are likely to face in society. Conversely, in a survey about how people's views of race were influenced by their parents1, 65 percent of White adults said their parents rarely or never spoke with them about race or racism. However, respondents whose parents did speak with them about racism as children were more likely to have similar conversations with their own children, resulting in inter-generational impact.The campaign aims to encourage White parents to help their children recognize and resist racism. The campaign features a website (https://DearWhiteParents.guide) with a curated library of age-driven resources and discussion guides, anti-racism workshops and discussions, and a short, unscripted film featuring four families introducing and discussing racism with their children. The film shares an intimate view of enlightening, sometimes uncomfortable, family discussions focused on parents helping their children understand racism through current events, as well as sharing their own stories about how they first became aware of racism. The ADL, a leading anti-hate organization, developed a custom discussion guide to help parents discuss the topics raised in the Dear White Parents film. Directed by Academy Award nominee Kevin Wilson, Jr., with narration by anti-racism educator Dr. Ronda Taylor Bullock, Dear White Parents asks the critical question, ""How old were you when you first became aware of race?"" ""I was six years old when I was called the n-word for the first time. It was a devastating experience and I remember it vividly,"" said Wilson. ""Dear White Parents is about the powerful impact that everyday conversations about race and racism can have on children. The weight of these discussions has fallen on Black and Brown parents for centuries. We want to encourage and equip White parents to share in this responsibility."" The campaign will be highlighted as part of the Ad Council's Racial Justice Series, a platform designed to support creatives from like-minded organizations dedicated to dismantling systemic racism and injustice. Through the Ad Council's support, the campaign will run and air in time and space donated by media outlets throughout the country.The project was conceived by Margenett Moore-Roberts, IPG DXTRA's Chief Inclusion and Diversity Officer, and it was developed and produced by IPG DXTRA, a global collective of advertising, marketing and communications agencies committed to leveraging its creative and strategic capabilities to deliver vital impact for people, businesses and society.

Following the company's $90 million Series D financing in March 2021, this newest round of financing values the company at $3.1 billion and brings Nuvemshop's total funding in the last 10 months to more than $620 million.Nuvemshop (also known as Tiendanube in Spanish speaking countries) empowers entrepreneurs to build and grow thriving online businesses. Nuvemshop's platform serves more than 90,000 merchants across Brazil, Mexico, and Argentina, ranging from direct-to-consumer (DTC) upstarts to an expanding roster of dominant brands such as PlayMobil, Billabong, Colombraro, Zaira Beauty, Osram, Lolja, Vitabe and StrappyCo. Today's funding will help accelerate the company's growth in current markets and support the company's geographic expansion into new countries, including Colombia, Chile and Perú.""With 650 million consumers, Latin America is not only a huge market, but it is the fastest growing e-commerce market in the world,"" said Matt Gatto, managing director at Insight Partners. ""By offering its powerful and easy-to-use platform, built and tailored specifically for Latin America, Nuvemshop is uniquely poised to continue to lead the region's digital transformation. We're thrilled to be part of its next chapter of incredible growth.""Despite the massive market, e-commerce in Latin America still represents only about 6 percent of retail sales in the region, compared with 30 percent or more in some other parts of the world. Nuvemshop projects the penetration rate will reach 60 percent over the next decade as smartphone usage continues to grow, digital banking increases, and logistics infrastructure improves. Furthermore, the pandemic year has become a dramatic accelerator for e-commerce and fintech products.In addition to geographic expansion, the funding will help Nuvemshop accelerate its payment and logistics capabilities, which will further drive e-commerce penetration in the region. In order to accelerate these capabilities, the company also plans to use its new funds for M&A opportunities.Earlier this year Nuvemshop launched a beta version of its own payments solution platform for merchants that enables faster and more secure purchases. It also reflects the Latin American consumers' approach to paying for retail purchases over time. A full 70% of the credit card transactions on the platform happen via installments. Since its beta launch, the new product has already seen explosive growth and will be made broadly available to all merchants over the course of the next year.Nuvemshop's logistics capabilities enable merchants to seamlessly deliver directly to consumers via partnerships and integrations with what would otherwise be a highly fragmented network of carriers. The company will continue to broaden its set of warehouse and carrier partners to help accelerate the adoption of e-commerce in Latin America by driving down the click-to-delivery time in most regions — now typically 5 to 6 days — to an eventual goal of the 1- or 2-day delivery, which is now standard in the U.S.""We envision a world in which anybody can convert a passion project into a thriving business,"" said Santiago Sosa, CEO and co-founder of Nuvemshop. ""From the start, we have focused on building solutions tailor-made for Latin American merchants. This singular purpose has cemented Nuvemshop as the standard for merchants in this region to build direct relationships with their customers. This additional funding will allow us to not only enable our merchants to be more successful, but will enable Nuvemshop as a platform to aggressively drive e-commerce progress in the region. Faster payments and reliably shorter delivery times will cause e-commerce to further explode in the region.""Nuvemshop will also expand its capabilities to serve larger merchants by expanding its sales and customer support staff, as well as continuing to invest in resources and support for its rapidly growing ecosystem of app partners and agencies.""Retailing is a very cultural-specific business and Nuvemshop's highly localized product and ecosystem of hundreds of app partners and agencies offer an unrivaled end-to-end solution for merchants and consumers,'' said John Curtius, Partner at Tiger Global Management. ""Nuvemshop not only has the technology and services that Latin American businesses require but an intimate insider's understanding of the cultural subtleties that will drive its customers' market success.

Our full launch in NovemberMore news about: Bearn","Bearn","SAN DIEGO, Aug. 14, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Bearn, a California-based wellness technology company, has signed an agreement to expand its marketplace capabilities and reach over 9M new, potential users. Bearn's unique wellness app rewards users for health and wellness activities including fitness, nutrition, weight management, sleep, stress management and more. Users of the Bearn app earn reward dollars for healthy behaviors. The new marketplace integration extends capabilities to include more than 4,500 retailers, offering unique rewards that users can purchase through their participation in health and wellness activities. With the Bearn app, the more focus individuals and families place on their health, the more they earn. This helps gamify wellness in new and powerful ways to help users become proactive about their health. As of July 21, 2021, marketplace users have redeemed $12.5M in travel and hotel redemptions, $5M in products and services, and have access to 21,000 reward offers across 4,500 retail brand partners across the US. Bearn Rewards & MarketplaceThe Bearn app framework gives users access to in-app scan technology to assess body dimensions and composition changes over time. The app features an innovative FaceScan technology that can measure a multitude of health and wellness attributes using the power of transdermal optimal imaging (TOI) analysis and advanced AI. The scanning technology is provided via a strategic alliance agreement forged with Australian-based Advanced Human Imaging (AHI). Aaron Drew, Bearn's CEO, and Vlado Bosanac, CEO of AHI, have partnered to integrate the cutting-edge, wellness tech available through the app users' mobile devices to democratize wellness and deliver this unique health assessment and reward platform to consumers directly on their personal devices. ""Now all you need is a cell phone to get immediate feedback about your health,"" says Bearn's CEO Aaron Drew. The first step in managing health is to establish a baseline and have a consistent and repeatable process to measure change. Previously, this has come at an extensive cost and time requirement to the individual. With the AHI scanning technology in place, users can assess their heart rate, metabolic risk, blood pressure and respiratory rate, along with dimension, composition and more, to provide solid biometrics to then use to monitor their health and risk. The app provides coaching and guidance to help users take the necessary steps to improve their health, while rewarding the right behaviors. It's a revolutionary approach to chronic disease prevention and health management that far exceeds simplistic approaches focused on heart rate and steps. With the marketplace integration, Bearn extends its reach while furthering abilities to reward users for being proactive about their health. Bearn will offer individual scans, as well as subscription packages, to the complete scan and risk assessment package for redemption in the Bearn Marketplace. This will be offered in which Bearn users and marketplace users can redeem earnings towards these products, as well as through the employer and payer funded model to leverage scan assessment and data – essentially paying employees and the insured to actively improve and measure their health and wellness. ""We're excited to integrate the Bearn marketplace with functional digital health and wellness technology that can be used to improve population health. We have several additional partnerships in the works,"" says Drew.With the marketplace integration complete, we'll be able to bundle Bearn software and scan services like: FaceScans, BodyScan, and the CompleteScan combination in subscription packages to reach a larger audience. Bearn customers can apply their earnings and employer-sponsored incentive dollars to purchase these innovative upgrades to get even more value out of their Bearn subscription and even more insight into their health.The newly integrated application will be made available to all Bearn partners which currently represents a potential pre-registered pool of users totaling 56,000,000 million. Bearn will launch with Accuro, who represents brand such as 9Round and Anytime Fitness. In addition to Accuro, we will also be launching with Perk Plans, Pinnacle Health, OnCore Golf Technology that will represent an initial release to 12,500,000 users. A number of these partners will be paying for their users to take the scans provided by AHI as part of their onboarding and initial data capture to set their rewards starting point. These partners will pay for the users to utilize the scans which will represent a minimum of 1,100,000 million potential monthly users.CEO and Founder of Bearn Aaron Drew said.""The assistance we have received from AHI both in early financial support and the technology integration, has played a big role in advancing the technology and attractive both partners and the immense number of users we have pre-registered. I believe Bearn will become the leader in wellness reward and health outcomes. No other platform offers the rewards we do or the ability to capture real-time data for goals and engagement. Bearn is currently closing a Series A investment round of $20M that includes both strategic and institutional capital partners. Our full launch in November will be an exciting move for our company and our new partners and investors.""About BearnBearn is an exciting and new multi-sided health platform that has a unique experience for consumers, advertisers, and corporations.

(""DBG"") (NASDAQ: DBGI), a curated collection of luxury lifestyle, digital-first brands, today reported financial results for its second quarter ended June 30, 2021.Second quarter 2021 net loss attributable to common stockholders was $10.7 million, or $1.97 per diluted share, on revenue of $1.0 million. The net loss included a non-cash expense associated with stock-based compensation expense associated with the IPO of $3.9 million and a non-cash expense associated with a change in the fair value of contingent liabilities of $3.1 million.""Our second quarter 2021 results reflect a meaningful improvement in our business results from our first quarter results as we were able to benefit from the cash inflows from our IPO in the middle of May,"" said Hil Davis, Chief Executive Officer of Digital Brands Group. ""These improving business trends have continued into the third quarter, and we expect them to improve throughout the third and fourth quarters of 2021 now that we have sufficient cash and inventory to support expected levels of operations.""""As we stated in our first quarter 2021 earnings release, a combination of factors negatively impacted our pre-IPO results, which included limited cash, limited inventory, minimal marketing spend, and the continued effects of COVID-19's impact on Bailey 44,"" said Reid Yeoman, Chief Financial Officer of Digital Brands Group. ""We are experiencing improving results as we move past our IPO date in May as we are able to use the IPO cash proceeds to order inventory, spend on marketing and invest into our brands.""Since our IPO this past May, which bolstered our balance sheet with cash for working capital, we have been able to:ship inventory for DSTLD, which is contributing to our improved results in July and August; ship Bailey 44 product to wholesale accounts starting mid-May, with a significant acceleration in wholesale booking orders for this fall that are in-line with pre-pandemic wholesale levels, and; develop a marketing and advertising plan, including an Amazon marketing strategy, which we are rolling out starting mid-July, with the majority of the spend starting this fall. Finally, as we discussed in our S-1, we expect to continue to grow through acquisitions and expect to continue to acquire companies this year, most of which will require GAAP PCAOB audits. These audits take time, which results in a delayed acquisition timeframe weighted toward the back three to four months of 2021. Davis concluded, ""this is really the tale of two companies, one pre-IPO with limited cash, inventory and marketing dollars and one post-IPO with a stronger cash position, fully stocked inventory and a meaningful marketing budget and strategy to drive revenue and earnings. We believe that our second quarter results, which only benefited from six weeks of the IPO cash proceeds, reflect this. We expect the bulk of the post-IPO benefit to come in the third and fourth quarter as inventory is 100% in stock, the marketing strategy is in full force and Bailey-44 wholesale shipments are back to pre-pandemic levels.""Second Quarter 2021 HighlightsNet Sales were $1.0 million versus $664,000 in the year ago quarter, an increase of 51% year over year. The increase in net sales was driven by the increase in revenue at Bailey 44 and the addition of Harper & Jones on a pro-rata basis. Our gross profit margin increased 79.7% year over year to 39.3% from negative 40.4%. Gross profit increased by 663,000 due to improved gross margins at all our brands. Net loss attributable to common stockholders was $10.7 million, or $1.97 per diluted share, compared to net loss attributable to common stockholders of $2.3 million, or $3.41 per diluted share, in the prior year period. Net loss in the second quarter of 2021 included a non-cash expense associated with stock-based compensation expense associated with the IPO of $3.9 million and a non-cash expense associated with a change in the fair value of contingent liabilities of $3.1 million. In addition to second quarter results, we wish to make you aware of the following:Third quarter operating results will experience similar, although less adverse impacts by those factors which impacted the first and second quarter operating results.

About Digital Brands GroupWe offer a wide variety of apparel through numerous brands on a both direct-to-consumer and wholesale basis. We have created a business model derived from our founding as a digitally native-first vertical brand. Digital native first brands are brands founded as e-commerce driven businesses, where online sales constitute a meaningful percentage of net sales, although they often subsequently also expand into wholesale or direct retail channels., Unlike typical e-commerce brands, as a digitally native vertical brand we control our own distribution, sourcing products directly from our third-party manufacturers and selling directly to the end consumer. We focus on owning the customer's ""closet share"" by leveraging their data and purchase history to create personalized targeted content and looks for that specific customer cohort. We have strategically expanded into an omnichannel brand offering these styles and content not only on-line but at selected wholesale and retail storefronts. We believe this approach allows us opportunities to successfully drive Lifetime Value (""LTV"") while increasing new customer growth. Digital Brands Group, Inc.

This latest capital injection follows the company's $1m seed round in July 2020, the award of a $704k 'Accelerating Commercialisation' Grant by the Australian Federal Government in November 2020, and Sicona's participation in the prestigious Startmate accelerator in its Summer 2021 climate technology cohort.Sicona, founded in June 2019 by experienced entrepreneur, Christiaan Jordaan, and Andrew Minett, a highly credentialed materials scientist, is developing next-generation battery technology used in the anodes (negative electrodes) of lithium-ion (""Li-ion"") batteries that enables electric mobility. Sicona is commercialising innovative silicon-graphite composite battery anode and binder process technology and materials, developed and perfected over the last ten years at the Australian Institute for Innovative Materials (AIIM) at the University of Wollongong. Sicona's current generation silicon-graphite composite anode materials deliver 50% to 100% higher capacity than conventional ""graphite-only"" materials and as a result, its cell producer customers can unlock more than 50% higher cell energy density than current Li-ion batteries thereby increasing electric vehicle range whilst reducing the cost and the time it takes to charge.According to a recent report prepared by Accenture for the Future Battery Industries Cooperative Research Centre (FBICRC), of which Sicona is an associate participant, diversified battery industries could contribute $7.4 billion annually to Australia's economy and support 34,700 jobs by 2030. One of the six opportunities identified in the report for Australia to expand its presence across the battery value chain is the establishment of ""active materials manufacturing capability to serve the global value chain"". This is where Sicona comes into play with its plans to establish domestic commercial-scale advanced manufacturing of its next-generation active anode materials.The global lithium battery opportunity is growing rapidly with more than 4TWh (equivalent to 4,000 gigawatt sized factories) of announced cell production requiring in excess of four million tonnes of anode materials per annum. From its Australian base, Sicona also has its eyes firmly set on deploying commercial-scale production plants in Europe and North America.Sicona founder and CEO, Christiaan Jordaan said: ""The energy density of current lithium-ion batteries is limiting performance, resulting in multiple issues including higher upfront costs and lower range for electric vehicles. It is our mission to provide scalable next-generation materials at an affordable cost to our customers. Sicona's unique silicon-graphite anode products solve the technical challenges experienced by using silicon in a battery but at a fraction of the cost of competing approaches due to our simple and scalable production process.We are taking multiple products to market, including the binder system, conductive carbons and active anode materials. Furthermore, we are solving key supply chain issues by taking a leading role in deploying our technology in Australia, Europe, and North America, thereby disrupting the Chinese concentrated supply chain.We are extremely grateful for the support from our growing international investor base. Our next milestone is the commissioning of Sicona's pilot production plant at our site in Wollongong and leveraging its larger-scale production capacity to qualify our materials with global battery producers and conduct larger-scale battery testing programs.""Alexandra Clunies-Ross, Artesian cleantech portfolio manager commented: ""From the onset, we were very impressed by the Sicona team's combination of technical and commercial acumen, their clear understanding of the battery materials market and supply chains, and the challenges to scaling new materials technologies from the laboratory into commercial production. We are impressed with their fast growth and are pleased to continue supporting Christiaan, Andrew, and the Sicona team."" Kevin Wang, Vice President at Riverstone Holdings said: ""We are excited to support Sicona with this funding round as it is looking to scale its ground-breaking battery materials technology and leverage its successes into the fast-growing markets developing for lithium-ion batteries in Europe and the United States."" Zarmeen Pavri, Partner at SDGx Ventures: ""At SDGx, we invest in deep tech companies that have the potential to create a meaningful and measurable impact on reducing greenhouse gas emissions whilst scaling up to transform the largest industries in the world.

The financing round is led by Link Ventures, the Boston-based fund that found Breeze through its proprietary sourcing algorithms, and includes participation from Northwestern Mutual Future Ventures, Silicon Valley Bank, M25, Fiat Ventures, and Invest Nebraska.Continue ReadingBreezeLaunched in 2020 by Colin Nabity and Cody Leach, Breeze has built insurance technology that makes it easier to apply and underwrite supplemental insurance products like income protection and critical illness insurance. The company offers consumers a completely digital way to quote, apply, and bind policies that offer protection in the event of cancer, heart attacks, strokes, and other medical conditions that can lead to a loss of income and cause financial trauma.With the funding, Breeze will accelerate the growth of its core products — disability and critical illness insurance — while also adding new products, carriers, and agents to its digital platform. The insurtech company also plans to build out its software development, customer service, distribution, and marketing teams.""Breeze caught our attention given its tremendous web traffic growth. We were also very impressed by Colin and Cody's deep carrier relationships and their customer-obsessed mentality. We are thrilled to be part of fueling Breeze to become the category leader in disability insurance. The market remains largely untapped, but Breeze can change that quickly with its technology and online platform,"" said Lisa Dolan, Managing Director at Link Ventures.Over 25% of today's 20 year-olds will become disabled before they retire, yet the U.S. individual disability insurance market remains very small with only around $430 million written in premium in 2020.By making disability insurance easier to buy and sell online, the insurtech can grow the stagnant market that has been limited by carriers and agents selling the product the same way for over 20 years. ""Breeze has been hard at work developing solutions that help protect individual's financial lives, their families and their peace of mind. This is a product that's been grossly underutilized by Americans, but is a critical one with Breeze leading the way to make this more accessible like never before,"" said Alex Harris, General Partner at Fiat Ventures. ""We're lucky to have worked with some of the top teams and founders in the fintech space, and Colin, Cody and the Breeze team stand out amongst an impressive crowd as innovators who are dedicated to solving these tough challenges.""Breeze's $10 million Series A is the largest first round of institutional capital ever invested in a Nebraska-based software startup, a testament to the growth prospects for the insurtech disruptor.""Accelerating technology that can transform our industry and help more consumers achieve financial security is core to our company,"" said Craig Schedler, Managing Director at Northwestern Mutual Future Ventures. ""Through their innovative solution and simplified approach, Breeze is disrupting the disability insurance market and creating a better experience for consumers.""With Breeze's platform, individuals can check their rates with a quick, personalized quote for disability insurance or critical illness insurance and complete the application process in just 10 minutes — all completely online.""We founded Breeze to close a glaring coverage gap — specifically, the 51 million working Americans without adequate income protection,"" said Colin Nabity, Co-founder and CEO at Breeze.""Above all, this means making affordable insurance more accessible. Historically, products like disability income insurance and critical illness insurance have been overpriced and too difficult to obtain. We're changing that,"" concluded Nabity.About Breeze:Breeze is a mission-driven insurtech company focused on helping individuals and families prepare for the unexpected. Leveraging industry expertise and innovative technology, our remote-friendly team is building a better way to buy insurance for life's most financially vulnerable moments — like cancer, heart attacks, and bad accidents.

Distributions on the Series A Preferred Units are due to be paid or accrued semi-annually in arrears More news about: Summit Midstream Partners, LP","Summit Midstream Partners, LP","HOUSTON, Aug. 6, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Summit Midstream Partners, LP (NYSE: SMLP) (""Summit"", ""SMLP"" or the ""Partnership"") announced today its financial and operating results for the three months ended June 30, 2021, including a net loss of $19.7 million, adjusted EBITDA of $62.1 million and DCF of $46.5 million. Net loss for the quarter included $31.5 million of non-cash charges including (i) a $19.3 million loss contingency accrual related to a previously disclosed incident dating back to a 2015 release of produced water from a pipeline owned by Meadowlark Midstream and (ii) an $12.2 million accrual related to Energy Capital Partners' full exercise of equity warrants in exchange for 414,477 SMLP common units. Operated natural gas volume throughput averaged 1,441 million cubic feet per day (""MMcf/d"") and liquids volume throughput averaged 63 thousand barrels per day (""Mbbl/d""). Operated natural gas volumes increased 7.1% relative to the first quarter of 2021, largely due to continued strong performance from the four Utica Shale wells connected in the first quarter of 2021 and 20 new wells that were turned-in-line during the second quarter of 2021 across the Utica Shale, Williston Basin and Marcellus Shale segments. Quarterly liquids volume throughput decreased by 3.1% relative to the first quarter of 2021, primarily as a result of natural production declines.Heath Deneke, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, commented, ""Summit's second quarter financial and operational results far exceeded our original expectations set in March, and adjusted EBITDA of $62.1 million was in line with our recently increased full year 2021 adjusted EBITDA guidance range of $225 million to $240 million. Our quarterly results were driven largely by our continued focus on operational excellence and proactive cost management efforts, together with robust performance from well connections to date. We are encouraged by the substantially improved commodity price backdrop and we continue to see signs of increasing customer activity around our footprint as we look ahead to 2022, particularly in our Permian, Williston and Utica segments. We remain optimistic that this positive momentum will continue to build through the end of the year and into 2022."" ""We are making excellent progress towards achieving our holistic refinancing plans of our 2022 debt maturities, which is expected to include a new $400 to $500 million asset-based revolver and a new high yield notes offering of $700 to $750 million. To date, we have received $400 million of ABL Revolver commitments from existing lenders and new lenders, conditioned on the successful arrangement of a new high yield notes offering that we expect to launch during the third quarter of 2021. When completed, the ABL Revolver and new high yield notes will provide a comprehensive financing solution for Summit with enhanced financial flexibility, sufficient liquidity to grow the business and a multi-year runway to continue harvesting substantial free cash flow to further de-lever the balance sheet and drive significant unitholder value going forward. Completing this refinancing plan is the top priority for our team and we are excited about closing this comprehensive financing solution and removing an overhang that has negatively impacted our stakeholders for quite some time.""""We also continue to make excellent progress with construction of the Double E Pipeline while maintaining a premier project safety and compliance record. With construction now approximately 60% complete, we are ahead of schedule and we are well on track to place the project in-service during the fourth quarter of 2021. Additionally, we continue to expect to deliver the project below the $425 million revised budget with approximately $30 million of uncommitted contingency remaining in the budget.""""Additionally, we recently announced that we have entered into agreements with the government to resolve investigations into the previously disclosed discovery in January 2015 of a produced water spill into Blacktail Creek, near Marmon, North Dakota (the ""Blacktail Release""). The spill occurred on a produced water gathering system owned by Meadowlark Midstream, which has been a subsidiary of SMLP since 2016. We have been working to resolve this matter since 2015 and I'm pleased that we have reached a satisfactory settlement resolution for all parties. As part of the settlement, SMLP has agreed to pay an aggregate amount of $36.3 million, which has been fully accrued, and which will be paid over a period of six years to the state of North Dakota and the federal government. A portion of the settlement proceeds will provide funding for supplemental environmental projects in the region. The settlement remains subject to court approval to become effective.""""Safety and the environment are of the utmost importance to Summit, our board and all of our employees. Since the Marmon spill, SMLP has invested approximately $75 million in related environmental remediation efforts as well as made improvements to our operating systems and our company-wide processes and procedures that we believe are leading edge among industry pipeline management best practices.""2022 Maturities – Refinancing UpdateOver the last several months, Summit has initiated a comprehensive plan to refinance its existing $1.1 billion revolving credit facility, due May 2022 (the ""Revolver"") and 5.50% senior unsecured notes due 2022 (the ""2022 Notes"" and together with the Revolver, the ""2022 Maturities""). As of today, the 2022 Maturities have an aggregate outstanding principal balance of approximately $969 million, comprised of approximately $735 million outstanding under the Revolver, net of cash, and approximately $234 million outstanding under the 2022 Notes.To date, Summit has secured $400 million of commitments from a syndicate of existing and new lenders for a new, 4.5-year, asset-based revolving credit facility, based on the value of Summit's above-ground fixed assets. The closing of the ABL Revolver is conditioned on the successful arrangement of a new $700 million to $750 million high yield notes offering (the ""New HY Notes""), which Summit expects to launch and close before the end of September 2021, and other customary closing conditions. The ABL Revolver and the New HY Notes will be scheduled to close concurrently in the third quarter of 2021, and collectively, the proceeds will be used to refinance the 2022 Maturities.Second Quarter 2021 Business Highlights In the second quarter of 2021, SMLP's average daily natural gas throughput for its operated systems increased by 7.1% to 1,441 MMcf/d, and liquids volumes decreased by 3.1% to 63 Mbbl/d, relative to the first quarter of 2021. SMLP's customers are currently operating five drilling rigs on acreage behind SMLP's gathering systems and had approximately 22 DUCs in inventory upstream of its systems as of June 30, 2021, with visible line of sight to completions for the majority of these DUCs by the end of the third quarter of 2021.Core Focus Areas:Core Focus Areas generated combined quarterly segment adjusted EBITDA of $32.7 million and had combined capital expenditures of $3.8 million in the second quarter of 2021. Utica Shale segment adjusted EBITDA totaled $10.7 million, a 38.0% increase over the first quarter of 2021, which was driven primarily by an 86 MMcf/d increase in quarterly volume throughput. The 4-well pad that was connected in March of 2021, produced in excess of 170 MMcf/d in the second quarter and six new wells were turned-in-line behind the TPL-7 interconnect during the quarter. At June 30, 2021, our Utica Shale customers had four DUCs, which are all expected to be turned-in-line by the end of the year. Both the 4-well pad that was connected in the first quarter and these four DUCs are subject to a gathering agreement we amended last year, structured to incentivize accelerated upstream activity and increased throughput volumes behind our SMU system. Ohio Gathering segment adjusted EBITDA totaled $6.8 million, which is in-line with first quarter of 2021, driven by lower operating expenses, which were partially offset by lower revenues due to a 7.9% decrease in volume throughput. Three wells were connected during the second quarter of 2021, and there are four DUCs that are expected to be turned-in-line in the third quarter of 2021. Williston Basin segment adjusted EBITDA totaled $9.6 million in the second quarter of 2021, a 10.9% decrease from the first quarter of 2021, primarily as a result of higher operating expenses and 2 Mbbl/d of reduced liquids volume throughput and changes in customer volume mix. Two wells were connected behind the Bison gas gathering system in the second quarter of 2021 and quarterly natural gas volume throughput of 12 MMcf/d was in-line with the first quarter 2021 results. There were six DUCs in inventory behind our liquids focused system as of June 30, 2021, all of which are expected to be turned-in-line by the end of the third quarter. DJ Basin segment adjusted EBITDA totaled $5.1 million in the second quarter of 2021, a 4.5% decrease from the first quarter of 2021, primarily due to changes in customer volume mix. Second quarter volume throughput averaged 23 MMcf/d, which was in-line with first quarter volume throughput and as of June 30, 2021, there were no DUCs behind our DJ Basin infrastructure expected to be turned-in-line in the near-term. Permian Basin segment adjusted EBITDA totaled $0.5 million in the second quarter of 2021, a decrease of approximately $0.2 million compared to the first quarter of 2021, largely due to increased operating expenses for compressor related maintenance and property taxes, despite flat quarterly throughput volumes of 29 MMcf/d. There were no new wells connected during the quarter and no DUCs currently behind the Permian system; however, there has been an increase in commercial discussions that could result in incremental volumes in the fourth quarter of 2021.Legacy Areas:Legacy Areas generated $35.1 million of combined segment adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter of 2021 and had combined capital expenditures of -$0.5 million, after accounting for certain expense reimbursements for previously capitalized projects which were received during the quarter. Piceance Basin segment adjusted EBITDA of $20.3 million decreased by 3.4% from the first quarter of 2021, primarily due to 14 MMcf/d of lower volume throughput, compared to the first quarter of 2021. There were no new wells connected in the second quarter behind our Piceance infrastructure and volume throughput decreased primarily as a result of natural production declines. Barnett Shale segment adjusted EBITDA of $8.9 million increased by 10.9% from the first quarter of 2021, primarily due to a combination of lower operating expenses, changes in customer margin mix and an increase in quarterly volumes. Although there were no new wells turned-in-line during the quarter, throughput volumes increased by 1.5% over the first quarter of 2021 due to workovers and recompletions of existing wells. Our customers have seven DUCs that are scheduled to be turned-in-line in the third quarter of 2021. Marcellus Shale segment adjusted EBITDA of $5.9 million increased 4.7% from the first quarter of 2021, driven primarily by a 5.9% increase in volume throughput, primarily as a result of nine new wells that were turned-in-line towards the middle of the second quarter, as expected.The following table presents average daily throughput by reportable segment for the periods indicated:Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, 2021 2020 2021 2020 Average daily throughput (MMcf/d): Utica Shale 496 416 453 319 Williston Basin 12 14 12 14 DJ Basin 23 20 23 26 Permian Basin 29 32 29 33 Piceance Basin 326 367 334 375 Barnett Shale 198 203 195 218 Marcellus Shale 357 339 347 351 Aggregate average daily throughput 1,441 1,391 1,393 1,336 Average daily throughput (Mbbl/d): Williston Basin 63 76 64 87 Aggregate average daily throughput 63 76 64 87 Ohio Gathering average daily throughput (MMcf/d) (1) 514 540 536 575 __________(1) Gross basis, represents 100% of volume throughput for Ohio Gathering, subject to a one-month lag.

Capital expenditures in the second quarter of 2021 were primarily related to growth projects to connect new pad sites in our Utica Shale and Williston Basin segments, which are expected to commence production in the second half of 2021.Six Months Ended June 30, 2021 2020 (In thousands) Cash paid for capital expenditures (1): Utica Shale $ 3,450 $ 1,482 Williston Basin 1,149 7,423 DJ Basin 3,758 8,428 Permian Basin (2,234) 4,921 Piceance Basin (719) 404 Barnett Shale 148 869 Marcellus Shale 293 430 Total reportable segment capital expenditures $ 5,845 $ 23,957 Corporate and Other 117 3,469 Total cash paid for capital expenditures $ 5,962 $ 27,426 __________(1) Excludes cash paid for capital expenditures by Ohio Gathering and Double E (after June 2019) due to equity method accounting. Capital & LiquidityAs of June 30, 2021, SMLP had $762 million drawn under its $1.1 billion Revolver and $314.9 million of undrawn commitments, after accounting for $23.1 million of issued, but undrawn letters of credit. Year-to-date through June 30, 2021, SMLP has reduced the drawn balance on the Revolver by $95 million, including $40 million in the second quarter of 2021. Subject to covenant limits, our available borrowing capacity at June 30, 2021 totaled approximately $138 million. SMLP also had $7.2 million of unrestricted cash on hand as of June 30, 2021.Based upon the terms of SMLP's Revolver, and total outstanding debt, net of cash, of $1.25 billion (inclusive of $493.5 million of senior unsecured notes), SMLP's total leverage ratio and first lien leverage ratio (as defined in the credit agreement) as of June 30, 2021, were 5.0 to 1.0 and 3.0 to 1.0, respectively, relative to maximum threshold limits of 5.75 to 1.0 and 3.50 to 1.0.Double E UpdateAs of today, construction of the Double E Pipeline is approximately 60% complete and all of the identified complex construction activities have been completed. The project is progressing ahead of schedule and costs continue to track well below budget. Summit continues to expect that it will commission Double E and commence service in the fourth quarter of 2021. Summit funded all of its $42.8 million of Double E capital calls in the second quarter of 2021 with borrowings under the non-recourse credit facilities at its wholly-owned, unrestricted subsidiary, Summit Permian Transmission, LLC (""Permian Transmission""). As of June 30, 2021, there was $53.5 million outstanding under the Permian Transmission credit facility.MVC Shortfall PaymentsSMLP billed its customers $11.5 million in the second quarter of 2021 related to MVC shortfalls. For those customers that do not have MVC shortfall credit banking mechanisms in their gathering agreements, the MVC shortfall payments are accounted for as gathering revenue in the period in which they are earned. In the second quarter of 2021, SMLP recognized $13.6 million of gathering revenue associated with MVC shortfall payments. SMLP had no adjustments to MVC shortfall payments in the second quarter of 2021.

Upcoming Investor ConferenceMembers of SMLP's senior management team will virtually attend the Citi 2021 Midstream Energy Conference on August 18, 2021. Presentation materials associated with this event will be accessible through the Investors section of SMLP's website at www.summitmidstream.com in advance of the conference.Use of Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresWe report financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP""). We also present adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure. We define adjusted EBITDA as net income or loss, plus interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, our proportional adjusted EBITDA for equity method investees, adjustments related to MVC shortfall payments, adjustments related to capital reimbursement activity, unit-based and noncash compensation, impairments, items of income or loss that we characterize as unrepresentative of our ongoing operations and other noncash expenses or losses, less interest income, income tax benefit, income (loss) from equity method investees and other noncash income or gains. Because adjusted EBITDA may be defined differently by other entities in our industry, our definition of this non-GAAP financial measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other entities, thereby diminishing its utility.Management uses adjusted EBITDA in making financial, operating and planning decisions and in evaluating our financial performance. Furthermore, management believes that adjusted EBITDA may provide external users of our financial statements, such as investors, commercial banks, research analysts and others, with additional meaningful comparisons between current results and results of prior periods as they are expected to be reflective of our core ongoing business.Adjusted EBITDA is used as a supplemental financial measure by external users of our financial statements such as investors, commercial banks, research analysts and others.Adjusted EBITDA is used to assess:the ability of our assets to generate cash sufficient to make future potential cash distributions and support our indebtedness; the financial performance of our assets without regard to financing methods, capital structure or historical cost basis; our operating performance and return on capital as compared to those of other entities in the midstream energy sector, without regard to financing or capital structure; the attractiveness of capital projects and acquisitions and the overall rates of return on alternative investment opportunities; and the financial performance of our assets without regard to (i) income or loss from equity method investees, (ii) the impact of the timing of minimum volume commitments shortfall payments under our gathering agreements or (iii) the timing of impairments or other income or expense items that we characterize as unrepresentative of our ongoing operations.Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool and investors should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. For example:certain items excluded from adjusted EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing an entity's financial performance, such as an entity's cost of capital and tax structure; adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; and although depreciation and amortization are noncash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements.We compensate for the limitations of adjusted EBITDA as an analytical tool by reviewing the comparable GAAP financial measures, understanding the differences between the financial measures and incorporating these data points into our decision-making process.We do not provide the GAAP financial measures of net income or loss or net cash provided by operating activities on a forward-looking basis because we are unable to predict, without unreasonable effort, certain components thereof including, but not limited to, (i) income or loss from equity method investees and (ii) asset impairments. These items are inherently uncertain and depend on various factors, many of which are beyond our control. As such, any associated estimate and its impact on our GAAP performance and cash flow measures could vary materially based on a variety of acceptable management assumptions.

(Smile CDR), a leading health data storage and integration company, today announced the closing of $20 million in Series A growth capital led by 30 North Group, a Seattle-based family office, and UPMC Enterprises. Smile CDR offers a suite of services that allow health systems, payers and hospitals to meet U.S. health information interoperability standards rapidly and securely. Smile CDR's data and integration platform includes a complete clinical data repository (CDR) built around the Health Level Seven (HL7®) Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR®) standard used for storing health records and supports all FHIR Resources. Continue ReadingSmile CDR Inc.""Smile CDR has seen significant growth in our core clinical data repository offering around the FHIR standard in the past year and today we partner with some of the largest health systems and insurers in North America,"" said Duncan Weatherston, Chief Executive Officer at Smile CDR. ""We have a bold vision for the future of healthcare and this new round of funding will allow us to explore new innovations that can continue to add value, improve care and save money."" Smile CDR is committed to the idea of a standardized and secure ""Internet of Health"" that allows health information to be shared from provider to provider and provider to patients, much in the same way that internet connection protocols created the ability for computers and servers to work together and communicate seamlessly and securely. The company will use this round of funding to drive a change in how healthcare information is created, stored and shared, moving beyond its core FHIR-based offering. ""Up until this point, we've succeeded by focusing our expertise on developing groundbreaking products that help payers and providers achieve successful interoperability of health information,"" said Weatherston. ""The broad and successful move towards interoperability has created new opportunities for innovation that simply didn't exist in a system where information was not securely connected or portable. We now have the ability to build on that progress to create new products that move beyond interoperability and bring even more value to the market.""In 2020, the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) issued a Final Rule stating that health plans must have a patient access application programming interface (API) by July 1, 2021, to provide patients user-friendly access to their records anytime they need it. Earlier this summer, Smile CDR became the first company to receive the Drummond Group Payer and Patient Access FHIR API Certification, validating Smile CDR's platform as fully compliant with the HL7 U.S. Drug Formulary FHIR Implementation Guide referenced in the Patient Access API requirements of the CMS Final Rule.""The digitization and interoperability of healthcare are absolutely necessary to be able to provide high-quality care to patients and members, and Smile CDR has demonstrated validity and success in the digital quality space with one of our portfolio companies, Astrata, Inc.,"" said Brent Burns, Executive Vice President at UPMC Enterprises. ""Smile CDR's future vision aligns perfectly with our core principle of creating healthcare innovations that significantly impact the lives of patients.""Since 2019, Smile CDR has seen rapid growth with a 400% year-over-year employee growth rate fueled organically by revenues from the company's core FHIR offering. The company partners with more than 23 payers across the U.S., including three of the 10 largest insurers and health plans, in addition to customers in more than 15 countries across the Americas, EMEA and APAC.Smile CDR's legal advisors in conjunction with this financing were Davies Ward Phillips & Vineberg LLP.About Smile CDRSmile CDR is a health technology company that reduces barriers between information and care for those who consume or provide healthcare services with complex information systems.

The company also announced $20 million in Series A funding, led by ForgePoint Capital. Spearheaded by an experienced team of cybersecurity and channel experts, SolCyber will use this investment to extend its technology offerings, build market awareness, drive customer growth and support an aggressive hiring strategy. The dramatic increase in cybersecurity and ransomware attacks such as Colonial Pipeline and Kaseya REvil prove attackers don't discriminate based on an organization's size. Hackers use the same advanced techniques no matter the target, making it extremely difficult for mid-market organizations with limited resources and budgets to be in control. Unlike competitive offerings, SolCyber immediately uplifts a company's security posture to a level that can combat advanced threats. ""We know it is hard for mid-sized organizations to stay secure. There are thousands of security technologies and hundreds of providers. Trying to figure out how to build the right security stack is tough and time consuming. With attacks being ever more sophisticated we want to help simplify the challenge of securing an organization,"" stated Scott McCrady, CEO. ""We founded SolCyber to help companies significantly increase the probability of stopping attackers well before they wreak havoc. SolCyber delivers a modern and secure MSSP for the mid-market, giving organizations not only the technology but the cybersecurity expertise to dramatically increase their security posture in an incredibly easy to consume model. We are thrilled to partner with ForgePoint and look forward to our next phase of growth.""In today's dynamic environment and pervasive threat landscape, companies are very concerned about increasing their security posture. Through decades of conversations with customers, SolCyber recognizes that companies typically look for the top five things they can do to be more secure. However it's extremely difficult to navigate today's array of cybersecurity vendors for the best combined solution for their environment, especially as attackers are becoming more sophisticated. SolCyber addresses this challenge by providing security solutions in a high value foundational offering. It delivers a curated technology stack including endpoint with EDR capabilities, lateral movement detection, advanced email security and active directory and admin exploitation prevention, wrapped in an MSSP Offering. SolCyber enables organizations to scale their security with ease.""We are dedicated to investing in companies that protect the digital future,"" stated Don Dixon, Managing Director, ForgePoint Capital. ""Over the years we've spoken with hundreds of cybersecurity companies and end users. And one thing remains the same, cybersecurity for the mid-market is confusing and expensive, and today's MSSPs are not addressing these issues. This presents a huge opportunity for SolCyber.SolCyber, which was incubated at ForgePoint, is a user-friendly, cloud based MSSP that delivers powerful cybersecurity solutions which keep companies and their employees safe from malicious activity. We are thrilled to partner with Scott McCrady, David Emerson and the entire SolCyber team as they launch the next phase of the company's growth.""Rizek Group, one of the largest and most prominent diversified business groups in the Dominican Republic partnered with SolCyber to increase its security posture around email, endpoint and active directory service.

In the report, senior industry analyst Carla Roncato of Enterprise Strategy Group (ESG) takes a deep dive into the current issues surrounding application security and access management, while illustrating how organizations can harness Pathlock's industry-leading access orchestration to safeguard sensitive data in critical applications.Access the full report from The Enterprise Strategy Group (ESG) here.Even the most mature, established organizations are struggling to balance compliance while trying to stay agile and accelerate digital transformation. Typically, organizations must choose whether to forgo typical control and visibility to move quickly, or enforce costly and time-consuming manual processes for compliance that slow down the business. Pathlock's Access Orchestration platform takes a new approach, automating the enforcement of a zero trust philosophy without additional delays or overhead, in turn implementing sustainable application security.User access reviews can be laborious, often leading to bottlenecks that result in too many permissions left granted well past the intended time period. Pathlock's Control platform provides employees across departments with the visibility, intelligence, and automation needed to manage to least privilege access. Furthermore, Pathlock's segregation of duties presents an analytical view into business processes to ensure compliant provisioning by managing actual violations of access risks. Additionally, organizations who utilize Pathlock's Control platform have the flexibility to automate a wide range of event-driven scheduled reviews, as well as scheduled workflows that enforce accountability. Combining user access governance, data loss prevention, continuous behavioral and transaction monitoring, and least-privilege automation, Pathlock gives organizations the tools to make the journey to zero trust a reality. ""Access governance is incredibly time consuming, manual--fraught with human error and insider risks, especially when it comes to the core applications and systems for business operations such as Enterprise Resource Management (ERP), Human Capital Management (HCM), and Customer Relationship Management (CRM) that every organization depends upon. With the ongoing transformation of these business-critical applications to cloud-enabled environments, organizations must re-evaluate their access controls and address new cyber-related risks,"" said Carla Roncato, Senior Industry Analyst at The Enterprise Strategy Group (ESG). ""As a preeminent solutions provider of access governance, Pathlock's platform approach, breadth of integrations, and depth of monitoring controls enable organizations on a path to zero trust to secure application access for the new era.""""With more and more businesses moving applications to the cloud, it has been increasingly challenging to monitor user activity, track risk, and implement proactive security measures,"" said Kevin Dunne, President at Pathlock.

TrillerNet offers brands a unique content and technology solution, including direct deals with the influencers and celebrities. This branded content journey starts with short-form video and can easily expand into valuable long-form content distributed through the Triller Network, such as live-event boxing and music PPVs, fashion shows, and episodic reality content on TrillerTV.

The round is led by Origin Ventures with Alumni Venture Group, Gaingles and 500 Startups also participating. The company also announces Origin Ventures Partner Scott Stern will join Lumanu's board of directors. Lumanu CEO Tony TranIn the past nine months alone, Lumanu has seen significant growth in its network, as additional creators recognize the value of their content and embrace entrepreneurship. As creators elevate their businesses, they emphasize collaboration with clients, employees and vendors. Lumanu offers the flexibility required for creators to scale their businesses through stress-free solutions that set them up for success. By empowering creators, Lumanu hopes to drive a creative revolution that not only transforms the way the industry operates, but puts creators in the driver's seat.""As a creator, I love that I can share my passions with the world and have a direct, genuine connection with the audience. No other format allows for this,"" said Christy Carlson Romano, social media star, singer and actress best known for her roles in Even Stevens and voicing the title character in Kim Possible. ""However, my passion is also my business – and the industry is not always set up to support creators. Lumanu has been invaluable by eliminating so many of the pain points on the back end that I – and every creator – face when operating our businesses. This support benefits all creators and helps build a stronger creator community in which everyone can participate.""""We're incredibly excited to continue delivering creators and entrepreneurs the tools and resources they need to grow their businesses.

EarlyPay enables creators to easily send invoices and instantly receive payments for brand collaborations instead of waiting the customary 30-60 days – or worse, not getting paid at all, often due to lack of familiarity or noncompliance with an invoicing or PO process. The platform also enables users to share and protect their IP and brand, a process that can be complex and difficult to unwind if handled incorrectly.""Recent growth of the 'Creator Economy' has been astounding. These self-made solopreneurs are the modern-day hustlers that brands use to reach two entire generations of digital natives,"" said Scott Stern, Partner at Origin Ventures.

To date, Bbot has raised a total of $22.3 million. The investment allows Bbot to continue building its e-commerce platform and meet the rapidly growing demand from developers looking to code their own extensions and applications. Bbot was founded in 2017 to help restaurants, bars and other customers in the hospitality industry simplify their operations with in-venue and online ordering. Bbot's innovative platform has allowed restaurants and similar small and independent hospitality businesses to remain resilient and adapt to sudden changes accelerated by the pandemic such as the shift to contactless ordering and payments. As the industry navigates worker shortages, the platform also has the ability to help operators retain and attract employees thanks to its intuitive interface that makes dining experiences more convenient and efficient. ""Restaurateurs are always looking for new ways to provide excellent hospitality experiences,"" said Steve Simoni, CEO and co-founder of Bbot. ""The way guests want to order and pay has changed forever, and the need for innovative technology that can help business owners compete in today's digital world affordably and easily is crucial. With this funding, we will continue to invest in creating the most advanced technology platform so our customers can focus on providing high-quality hospitality experiences, instead of worrying about the tools and integrations.""In the last year, the company added over 700 customers and reached 85 employees across 14 states, seeing 700% year-over-year growth. This funding will help grow Bbot's platform based on the requests and needs of current customers, including new point of sale and loyalty integrations. The company will also focus on features for food halls and virtual brands, further establishing Bbot as the platform of choice for these operators. In addition, the investment will help Bbot finalize and ultimately launch a self-service Bbot app store, which will allow developers to immediately get started using Bbot's existing platform to code their own extensions and apps. ""We've spent the last four years creating a solid base for our technology that we can build upon,"" said Simoni. ""We are now focused on expanding our platform so developers can integrate the technology for their restaurant clients and create custom offerings."" Because technology preferences may differ depending on the setting, the platform will cater to a range of casual dining experiences across the hospitality sector, from bars and breweries to food halls and hotels. In some settings, this might mean sitting with your friends while ordering from your smartphone without ever having to walk up to the counter – in others, ordering room service from your smartphone rather than the television or waiting to be redirected by the front desk. This feature placed Bbot at number one overall on Hotel Tech Report's Global Best Mobile Ordering & Room Service Software list in the 2021 HotelTechAwards. ""Bbot has unique insight into the rapidly changing hospitality industry,"" said Reid Christian, General Partner at CRV. ""Their vision expands beyond the traditional POS industry, into a fully integrated software and payments platform enabling order and pay for the first time. This functionality enables hospitality operators and software developers to easily introduce features that are being demanded by their patrons and customers. With this latest round, Bbot will deepen its talented bench with key hires and provide additional product enhancements to support the rapidly growing customer base.""

We also present future period guidance for ""Non-GAAP adjusted operating margin"" and ""Non-GAAP effective tax rate."" Non-GAAP results exclude the impact of items that management believes affect the comparability or underlying business trends in our condensed consolidated financial statements in the periods presented. We also present certain information related to our current period results of operations through ""constant currency,"" which is a non-GAAP financial measure and should be viewed as a supplement to our results of operations and presentation of reportable segments under GAAP. Constant currency represents current period results that have been retranslated using exchange rates used in the prior year comparative period to enhance the visibility of the underlying business trends excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.Management uses non-GAAP results to assist in comparing business trends from period to period on a consistent basis in communications with the board of directors, stockholders, analysts, and investors concerning our financial performance. We believe that these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors and other users of our condensed consolidated financial statements as an additional tool for evaluating operating performance and trends. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, management believes it is helpful to evaluate our results excluding the impacts of various adjustments relating to special or non-recurring items. Investors should not consider these non-GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. CROCS, INC.

Outplay will use the funds raised to invest in technology and hiring exceptional talent across the globe.More news about: Outplay","Outplay","SAN FRANCISCO, July 21, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Multi-channel sales engagement platform, Outplay today announced its $7.3M series A fundraise from Sequoia Capital India. Outplay will use the funds raised to invest in technology and hiring exceptional talent across the globe.The Outplay team celebrating the announcement of Series A funding.Businesses today rely on a combination of inbound and outbound sales models to drive revenues. While the inbound sales process has rapidly evolved over the last decade, outbound sales hasn't. Outbound sales teams typically use high-volume tactics to drive revenue. But this approach isn't scalable and the revenue eventually becomes a function of the size of the outbound sales team. This is because outbound sales teams don't have a data-driven approach for targeting prospects that are most likely to convert and end up spending time emailing or cold-calling hundreds of prospects hoping to convert a few.Launched in 2019, Outplay is on a mission to change this by bringing predictability to outbound sales and help sales reps talk to the right prospect at the right time through the right channel. The platform helps outbound sales teams plan, execute, track, measure and optimize interactions between companies and prospects across multiple channels like email, phone, SMS, social media as well as live chat.Laxman Papineni, CEO of Outplay, commented,""Outbound sales teams are truly the dark horse of the sales organization - the targets are high, but the methods aren't scientific. Outplay is committed to making outbound outreach data-driven, so that sales teams are talking only to the warmest prospects at any given point across multiple channels, optimising time and resources. The continued partnership with Sequoia Capital India is a testament to the fact that the sales engagement space, which is poised to be a $5.59B market by 2023, is a huge opportunity for Outplay.""With Outplay, sales managers can create data-backed sales playbooks to coach team members and help achieve sales targets. The platform's combination of automation and personalization helps teams start genuine conversations at scale, enabling them to stay on task by using multiple channels through a single interface to drive more meetings. Sales reps are thus able to build a multi-channel outreach plan for prospects across email, phone, SMS, LinkedIn, Twitter and chat.For example, Outplay helps sales teams engage with warm prospects by notifying them when their prospect visits their website. Enabled by Outplay's industry-first outbound live-chat feature, the rep can initiate live chat and have a conversation with the prospect. Customers have been able to qualify prospects faster and grow pipeline by 300% using the tool alongside inbound chat.""We continue to be very excited by Outplay's mission of making every sales rep perform like the best rep on the team. Outbound sales needs are evolving rapidly and reps now need personalized, automated and contextual tools to drive sales which Outplay is successfully enabling. Sales reps spend an average of four hours per day on Outplay, demonstrating the effectiveness of the product which has category-leading customer reviews. Additionally, rapid digitization due to COVID has been a significant accelerant for the business and we believe these tailwinds will continue as outbound sales becomes more digital."" - Harshjit Sethi, Principal, Sequoia IndiaOutplay offers support to ensure software adoption across customer teams is done within days, not weeks or months. Since the seed fundraise - USD 2 Mn from Sequoia Capital India's Surge early this year, the company has grown 4X in revenue, 3X in team size and has customers from more than 50 countries.About OutplayOutplay is a multi-channel sales engagement platform that ensures outbound sales teams deliver the most powerful message at the perfect time in the buyer journey through the right channel. With features like dynamic sequencing, magic outbound chat and detailed analytics, Outplay gives sales development representatives (SDRs) and business development representatives (BDRs) the right signals so they only work on the warmest prospects across multiple channels like email, phone, SMS, LinkedIn, Twitter and Chat.Contact [email protected]SOURCE Outplay",TRUE

The funding will fuel the company's accelerating release of disruptive products focused on replacing the $60 billion of synthetic nitrogen fertilizer sold each year just to sustain corn, wheat, and rice. Synthetic nitrogen fertilizer supports the demands of today's global food system. But it is inefficient, expensive for farmers, contributes to seven percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, depletes soils, and harms water supplies and fisheries – synthetic nitrogen is no longer a viable solution for farmers and food security.Since the company introduced the industry's first commercially available microbial nitrogen in 2019, Pivot Bio has replaced synthetic nitrogen on more than 1 million crop acres in 2021 alone, representing more than 300% growth year-over-year and unprecedented agricultural product adoption. Pivot Bio's clean nitrogen immediately decreases and permanently prevents synthetic nitrogen emissions from the environment, potentially avoiding approximately $200 billion of environmental impact. Pivot Bio has achieved these breakthroughs with proprietary computational and microbiome technologies, multi-scale automated testing, and deep scientific expertise unrivaled by any other company in its market.Generation Investment Management, G2 Venture Partners, and Rockefeller Capital Management join returning investors in Pivot Bio's Series D, including Series D co-leads DCVC, also the Seed, Series A lead, and material investor in all funding rounds since the company's inception, and Temasek, also Series C co-lead; Breakthrough Energy Ventures, the Series B lead and Series C co-lead; Continental Grain Company; Prelude Ventures; Pavilion Capital; Bunge Ventures, the venture capital arm of the leading global agribusiness and food company Bunge; Tekfen Ventures; and Roger Underwood, the co-founder of industry-leading biological technology company Becker Underwood.

Developed in close consultation with farmers, the company's nutrient measurement tools, grower engagement programs, and a direct-to-farm supply chain adapt to the dynamic challenges on each farm, and deliver long-term, predictable revenue for both Pivot Bio and its farmer partners. Pivot Bio is the only company in the world to have shipped a synthetic nitrogen fertilizer replacement at scale with performance that meet farmers' tough requirements and the company expects to retain this position for years to come.""Pivot Bio is driven to serve farmers by simplifying the challenges of managing nitrogen and ensuring resilient farm productivity. We have built a platform for accelerating nitrogen innovation in the market, and our products are delivering recurring positive outcomes for the growers we serve,"" said Karsten Temme, Ph.D., Pivot Bio co-founder and CEO. ""We are establishing relationships that will span decades, and aim to provide the sole source of nitrogen needed to power the economic and environmental sustainability of global agriculture for generations to come.""Pivot Bio PROVEN® 40, the company's fourth commercial product in three years, enables farmers to replace up to 40 pounds per acre of synthetic nitrogen, almost double the performance of Pivot Bio's inaugural product. The product streamlines farming operations, potentially eliminating machinery and labor required to apply synthetic nitrogen. It represents a more consistent, weatherproof way to ensure nitrogen is delivered into the crop throughout the growing season instead of being left in the soil or lost from the field.""We have earned the trust of farmers for our direct-to-grower approach and have proven that our products provide consistent yields and profits for farmers, even in the face of a volatile climate,"" said Karsten Temme. ""Our track record of delivering a solution to address farmers' needs and remediate the challenges facing our planet has also earned us the support and confidence of our investors. The Pivot Bio team looks forward to continuing our success at scale.""Farmers urgently need a clean nitrogen source that supports the environmental needs of their farmland while delivering productivity. Crops only use about half of the total synthetic nitrogen applied to agricultural fields. A portion of the unused synthetic nitrogen is emitted as nitrous oxide, a GHG that is 300 times more potent than carbon dioxide and other nitrogen gases. As a result, synthetic nitrogen has become the leading cause of crop-related GHGs. Unused synthetic nitrogen also ends up in our waterways in the form of nitrates, impacting water quality, and significantly contributing to the more than 500 global oceanic dead zones.Similar to the evidence of rising atmospheric CO2 levels that first emerged in the 1950s, there is now mounting proof that synthetic nitrogen is correlated to the degradation of farm soils. The more synthetic nitrogen is used to increase food supply, the more farm soil degrades and jeopardizes the entire food system increasingly year by year. Pivot Bio is committed to protecting farmers' land and preserving the global food system with current and sustained breakthrough innovation in crop nutrients.About Pivot BioAt Pivot Bio, we believe in meeting the needs of the present without compromising the needs of future generations. Our unparalleled understanding of the crop microbiome will help create a future with cleaner water and air. We are dedicated to providing farmers with solutions that enable them to grow high-quality, environmentally-responsible and sustainably focused crops to help feed families worldwide.

Besides ATO, the Polish fraud fighter has been flourishing in its payment and financial application use cases, systematically proving over 10 p.p. higher fraud detection precision than the conventional methods.Atmos Ventures and ARIA are leading Nethone's most recent fundraising alongside Innovation Nest, Plug and Play Ventures, Firlej Kastory and several business angel investors. Series A will allow Nethone to accelerate its go-to-market efforts and further strengthen its proprietary Know Your User (KYUTM) profiling technology to equip global leaders with the right tools against fraudsters. COVID-19 boosted the significance of cybersecurity given the pandemic-induced growth of demand for direct-to-customer online commerce (both web and mobile) and the associated next-generation financial services. The past 12 months provided Nethone with sufficient momentum to more than double its client base, but also enjoy increasing volumes in onboarded accounts across eCommerce, digital goods & services and financial services verticals.Fighting fraud in the COVID eraThe last year has seen an unprecedented spike in fraudsters' activities. COVID-19 has fueled a ""professionalization of fraud"" trend that Nethone has been observing systematically escalate since the company's inception in 2016. ""Barriers to entry for fraudster-wannabes have been steadily decreasing. More and more sophisticated SaaS-based tools became available for anyone with some financial resources at their disposal. Today, these are advanced technical solutions built by well-organized, highly experienced groups of rogue IT experts. Wrapped in a user-friendly interface and excellent customer support they allow for complex anonymisation and automation functionalities as well spoofing of historically trusted digital identities that most of the incumbent fraud detection solutions stand no chance of spotting"" – states Hubert Rachwalski von Rejchwald – Nethone's CEO. ""The forward-looking answer to anyone who wishes to effectively transact online is to deeply understand every single user, as they browse the website or use a mobile app. Our KYU profiling technology gives access to first-hand real-time insights about what is really happening with the device, how this device interacts with the servers of the platform and, last but not least, what is the raw behavior - keystrokes, mouse movements, gyro or accelerometer readings, touches on mobile). These are currently over 5000 attributes that we are extracting passively in the background about every single user thanks to years of targeted research and engineering, Importantly our goal is never to affect the customer journey by staying invisible in the background nor invade end-user privacy thanks to the low-level nature of the attributes we collect"" – adds Aleksander Kijek, Nethone's CPO.Besides expanding its go-to-market efforts, the plan is to use the capital to increase the velocity of roadmap progression with a constructive obsession with features that will maximize perceived utility among the company's target segments.Series A led by international investorsToday Nethone's market success is fueled by: (i) first-hand expertise concerning modus operandi of fraudsters automatically converted into engineering; (ii) unique profiling capabilities on mobile; (iii) state-of-the-art passive behavioural biometrics for recurring user authentication; and (iv) explainability of its machine learning that boosts client adoption.Nethone's new investors are internationally known for their investments in transformational high-tech scale-ups focused on research, development and commercialisation of cutting-edge technologies. ""With the post-COVID critical significance of fraud prevention and the fierce competition in creating the frictionless user experience, Nethone has a novel approach to profiling technology fueled by machine learning. And since Atmos is focusing on developing deep technologies in ML-driven commercial solutions, Nethone Profiler combined with the explainability of the machine learning models was an obvious choice for us,"" said Hadi Solh, Managing Partner at Atmos. ""We are elated to join the team to arm online merchants with deep tech tools against fraudsters.""""The accelerated growth of eCommerce in the pandemic era - up 30% in value by 2020, naturally increases the scale of fraud in the digital space. Nethone solves the problem of online payment and identity fraud, with annual losses worth around $50 billion. Their technology provides maximum protection without affecting the end-user experience. I see huge potential for the application of this technology, including other companies in our portfolio - wherever payments are involved. I am impressed with Nethone's highly motivated team, as well as the organizational maturity for an early-stage company. Nethone has proven successful in onboarding clients ranging from traditional banks to fast-growing start-ups across the globe"" - highlights Dariusz Lewandowski, CEO of ARIA.Diego Montes, Venture Capital Investor from Plug and Play Ventures underlines that Nethone's innovative user profiling, which encompasses more than 5,000 attributes, combined with ML and a specialized team of data scientists, has demonstrated the strength of Nethone's products.

Investors in the Series A included ARCH Venture Partners, F-Prime Capital, GV, and Newpath Partners. The Series B included all Series A investors, plus Casdin Capital, Cormorant Asset Management, Moore Strategic Ventures, Public Sector Pension Investment Board (PSP Investments), Redmile Group, Samsara BioCapital, funds and accounts advised by T. Rowe Price Associates, Inc., and a number of additional, unnamed life sciences investment funds.""Prime Editing is a wonderful example of the revolution in genetic medicine that we are living through,"" said Robert Nelsen, co-founder and Managing Director of ARCH Venture Partners. ""When mature, gene editing technologies like this could totally change our conception of what's possible in treating disease.""""This is an opportunity to take a giant step toward cures for a much wider range of diseases than previously possible,"" said Stephen Knight, MD, President and Managing Partner of F-Prime Capital.The funds raised will be used to continue building the company, rapidly advance towards clinical indications, expand the capabilities of the platform, and to further enhance the exceptional promise of Prime Editing. By the end of 2021, Prime Medicine expects to employ more than 100 people full-time.""Prime Editing represents an opportunity to do what no gene editing approach has yet been capable of – correcting nearly all types of pathogenic gene mutations, correcting multiple mutations at once, and bringing durable cures to patients across multiple disease areas, potentially with a single 'once and done' treatment approach,"" said David Schenkein, MD, General Partner at GV. ""We are tremendously excited about the potential of this technology, and about the talented team at Prime working to bring it to patients.""Prime Editing is a next-generation gene editing technology that acts like a DNA word processor to ""search and replace"" disease-causing genetic sequences at their precise location in the genome, without resulting in double-strand DNA breaks that cause unwanted cellular changes. It is versatile, with the potential to address more than 90 percent of known disease-causing mutations, and works in a variety of dividing and non-dividing primary human cells, as well as in animals. Prime editing has been shown by multiple independent laboratories to make genome edits with high fidelity, making edits precisely at the desired location with minimal or no editing in other parts of the genome. Together, these features overcome several technical barriers attributed to earlier gene editing technologies.""Prime Editing is a transformative technology that we believe will make a significant impact by addressing the fundamental causes of genetic disease,"" said Keith Gottesdiener, MD, CEO of Prime Medicine. ""Since Prime began operations in the summer of 2020, we have continued to make great progress in advancing the performance of Prime Editing, which allowed us to close our Series B financing nine months later. We are operating from a position of financial strength, and look forward to further developing the technology and progressing our preclinical programs toward the clinic, with the hope that they may cure or halt the progression of genetic diseases for patients."" Scientific Approach Prime Editing was developed by scientific founders David R. Liu, PhD and Andrew Anzalone, MD, PhD, at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. Dr. Liu is the Richard Merkin Professor, director of the Merkin Institute of Transformative Technologies in Healthcare, core institute member and vice chair of the faculty at the Broad Institute, and a professor of chemistry and chemical biology at Harvard University. Dr. Anzalone conceived of Prime Editing and brought it to Dr. Liu's laboratory, where it was developed. Dr. Anzalone is now advancing Prime Editing as Head of Prime Editing Platform at Prime Medicine.Prime Medicine is currently advancing multiple drug discovery programs targeted at liver, eye, ex-vivo hematopoietic stem cell, and neuro-muscular indications.A study describing Prime Editing's ability to ""search and replace"" to restore normal genetic function almost anywhere in the genome was first published in Nature in 2019. The technology was immediately and widely recognized as a major advance in gene editing, with the potential to overcome fundamental barriers that have prohibited existing gene editing approaches from addressing many genetic diseases. Since then, Prime Editing has been validated in numerous laboratories around the world and dozens of peer-reviewed articles.The technology works by using a prime editor protein comprising a Cas nickase domain and a reverse transcriptase domain, together with a prime editing guide RNA (pegRNA) that carries both a targeting sequence and a template for a replacement sequence. The prime editor searches for the specific DNA sequence that needs to be edited. Once located, the prime editor uses the pegRNA's ""replace"" sequence to activate the reverse transcriptase domain, which makes a DNA copy of the template carried by the pegRNA, creating a corrected DNA sequence. The corrected sequence then preferentially replaces the original genomic DNA, resulting in a permanent edit of the DNA at the target location.Prime Medicine also benefits from a relationship with Beam Therapeutics. Prime and Beam are separate companies that both emerged from the laboratory of Dr. David R. Liu. Sharing many common interests, Prime and Beam have built a partnership to form a collaborative approach to fighting disease and accelerating the development of Prime Editing to deliver therapies for patients. In the areas of partnership, Prime Medicine and Beam share research, expertise, and intellectual property for assays, know-how, delivery, and manufacturing.The Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard has extended a license for prime editing technology to Prime Medicine for human therapeutic uses under the Broad Institute's inclusive innovation model. Leadership team Biotech veteran Keith Gottesdiener, MD is president and chief executive officer of Prime Medicine. Dr. Gottesdiener helmed Rhythm Pharmaceuticals, Inc. for nine years, leading the company to FDA submission of IMCIVREE (setmelanotide), the first treatment for rare genetic diseases of obesity, which was rapidly followed by FDA approval. Over the course of Dr. Gottesdiener's tenure, Rhythm raised approximately $700 million through both private and public financings, as well as licensing deals, and grew from 3 employees to 100. Before joining Rhythm in 2011, Dr. Gottesdiener spent 16 years at Merck Research Laboratories, where he held positions of leadership across Merck's early and late clinical development organizations.The Prime Medicine leadership team brings significant company building, scientific and drug development experience and also includes:Jeremy Duffield, MD, PhD, Chief Scientific OfficerMeredith Goldwasser, ScD, SVP, Strategy and Corporate OperationsAndrew Anzalone, MD, PhD, Co-founder and Head of Prime Editing PlatformKaren Brown, PhD, JD, SVP Intellectual Property and Legal AffairsThe company's investors and board members are life sciences leaders with extensive experience building biotech companies pioneering novel technologies, including:Keith Gottesdiener, President and CEO, Prime MedicineStephen Knight, President and Managing Partner, F-Prime CapitalRobert Nelsen, Co-founder and Managing Director, ARCH Venture PartnersDavid Schenkein, MD, General Partner, GVJohn Evans, Chief Executive Officer, Beam Therapeutics About Prime Medicine Prime Medicine is a biotechnology company founded to deliver on the promise of Prime Editing, a versatile gene editing technology that can truly ""search and replace"" to restore normal genetic function and address the fundamental causes of disease.

This round was co-led by Forte Ventures and Drive Capital with additional funding from new investors Investissement Quebec, Castor Ventures, and Nikon-SBI Innovation Fund, as well as existing investors GM Ventures, Generation Ventures, and Intact Ventures.Algolux, empowering vision systems with the most robust perception technology for all conditions.Global automotive camera shipments are expected to surpass 300 million units by 2025, reaching $25B in revenue according to separate studies by Yole Developpement and Global Market Insights. Industry growth will continue to be fueled by increasing concerns regarding vehicle and passenger safety across the globe coupled with accelerating technological advancements in camera-based advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). In parallel, trucks are making great progress towards autonomy as their large size provides a better platform for computing and an improved field of view for sensors. Unfortunately, vision – the most widely deployed component of the overall perception stack - is still hampered by performance issues in low light and poor weather conditions making SAE Levels 2 and above more challenging to support. In fact, urban car crash fatalities and fatality rates have been rising for over a decade in the United States.Algolux's computer vision and image optimization solutions address the mission-critical issue of safety for ADAS and autonomous vehicles. Algolux is the first company to use computational imaging to design algorithms that treat the camera as part of the overall perception stack; a bold departure from the traditional siloed approach. This leads to the resolution of harsh cases such as low-light, low contrast, and obstructions for object detection, imaging, and geometric estimation. In addition, using physical camera models reduces training data needs by an order of magnitude. This results in Algolux technologies outperforming commercial solutions by as much as 60 points in mean average precision (mAP).""We are thrilled to be taking this next step in the company's trajectory and to do so with the trust and support of outstanding investors. Algolux is actively engaged with leading OEMs, Tier 1s, and Tier 2s globally. The consistent theme is a desire from customers to significantly improve the performance of their driving and parking vision systems in even the most challenging real-world situations,"" said Allan Benchetrit, Algolux CEO.""We fully expect that computer vision systems will be an increasingly important part of the future safety and functionality of vehicles, and a necessary complement to other sensors like LiDAR and Radar,"" said Louis Rajczi, Partner at Forte Ventures. ""We understand that these camera systems must function in extremely challenging environments (low light, poor weather, glare…) and believe Algolux has developed a world-class solution that provides exceptional performance in these types of conditions.""""We are proud to work with Algolux and to support its growth and innovation plans. Our participation demonstrates our desire to back Québec businesses in strategic industries that are ready to drive economic development. We are confident that Algolux, which already stands out as a leading AI provider in the advanced vehicle market, will succeed and make its mark, both here at home and around the globe,"" said Guy Leblanc, President and CEO of Investissement Quebec.Recently named to the 2021 CB Insights AI 100 List of the world's most innovative artificial intelligence startups, Algolux will use this funding to achieve the following three goals:Accelerate adoption of Algolux's award-winning products across mobility marketsGrow its engineering and customer enabling teams to scale worldwide supportExpand to additional vertical markets enabled by camera applicationsAs part of the funding round, Louis Rajczi, Partner at Forte Ventures, and Alistair Mitchell, President at Generation Ventures have joined the Algolux Board of Directors.

A few years ago, the company announced a major reorganization to focus on three areas: intelligent cloud services; intelligent edge experiences; andMore news about: GlobalInvestmentDaily.com","GlobalInvestmentDaily.com","LONDON, July 12, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Big Tech may be in for a major crisis in the coming months, all because of a global shortage virtually nobody's talking about. And it has nothing to do with the shortages we've seen worldwide in everything from computer chips to lumber to chicken wings. Mentioned in today's commentary includes: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Virgin Galactic (NASDAQ:SPCE), Maxar Technologies (NYSE:MAXR).This supply squeeze runs far deeper and has the potential to crush major blue-chip companies if the situation doesn't dramatically improve soon. That's because Big Tech companies like Amazon, Alphabet, and Netflix all depend on this gas to keep their servers running around the clock.The supply crunch has helped junior producers, like Avanti Energy Inc. (AVN.V – ARGYF), to raise over $100 million across the industry over the last year. It's also sent share prices parabolic for an average of 500% gains across these producers.High-Grade Discovery Found in the Heart of Helium CountryWith the demand for helium continuing to rise and the world's biggest supplier in the industry moving out, it's created the perfect recipe for a boom for small helium producers. And Avanti just made a major announcement that has the potential to make them a huge player in the United States market.Their world-class team just announced that they're working to acquire the helium rights to approximately 62,000 acres of land in Montana. And their neighbors have shown grades of up to 2% Helium and 96% Nitrogen in multiple targets nearby. And now, Avanti Energy has discovered several closed structural highs reaching up to 170m of relief on the property for which they're set to acquire a license.After doing a detailed analysis of both the property and the surrounding area, they were so confident in what they saw that they offered to buy licenses for roughly 50,000 acres of land. That makes it nearly 5x the size of their entire land portfolio before the acquisition of the license. While many aren't yet aware of the looming helium crisis, potential discoveries like these could be crucial for Big Tech and other major blue-chip companies in the near future.Supply Squeeze Putting Big Tech in a PinchAvanti's (AVN.V – ARGYF) announcement could have tremendous implications as we're in the middle of the biggest supply squeeze we've seen in years. And it's all surrounding a chemical that the entire world relies upon.Without sufficient helium for these companies, it could mean no internet, no computers or cell phones, no computer chips for the latest vehicles, and no MRIs for those who desperately need them.For over seven decades, the US Federal Helium Reserve (FHR) has provided roughly 40% of the world's helium supply. The supply has been slowly dwindling for years… And in September, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) is set to auction off the rest of the helium to the private markets.That could send helium prices sky-high...This is why with helium demand now set to outpace supply until at least 2025, the race is on for junior helium producers to make new discoveries to even the score. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been one of Big Tech's most steadfast adopters of green energy. And that's largely due to to Steve Jobs' incredible vision. From data centers to the company's products and even the packaging, Apple has committed to a greener tomorrow in a big way, and its doing so with the help of renewable energy, alternative fuels and sustainable materials. As one of Big Tech's leaders in sustainability, Apple will be a company to watch as new materials are introduced into the energy mix. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is an American multinational corporation that engages in the Internet, technology, and media industries. Alphabet has been a public company since 2004, when it was created as a subsidiary of Google. It became its own entity in 2015 with the introduction of its new parent company Alphabet which replaced Google as its corporate umbrella. Alphabet is also going all in on its green energy objectives, powering data facilities with hydrogen and other renewable sources. ""We are committed to doing our part. Sustainability has been a core value for us since Larry and Sergey founded Google two decades ago. We were the first major company to become carbon neutral in 2007,"" CEO Sundar Pichai explained.Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is one of the world's largest and most powerful companies. They are known for their Windows operating system, Xbox gaming console, Office suite, and Microsoft Surface tablet series. A few years ago, the company announced a major reorganization to focus on three areas: intelligent cloud services; intelligent edge experiences; and more personal computing experiences. These changes were made as a result of Satya Nadella's vision for ""cloud-first, mobile-first"" technology strategy back in July 2014 when he took over as CEO from Steve Ballmer who has been at the helm since 2000. Microsoft has made great strides in green energy.

The Florence-based company has built a universal delivery technology that helps ecommerce brands increase delivery speed and efficiency, automate tracking and returns, and manage the complexity of cross-border shipping. Francesco Borghi (CEO) and Lorenzo Rogai (CTO) founded ShippyPro in 2016 with the goal of creating a universal shipping technology that could be used by any company in the ecommerce space. ""The global logistics network is still highly fragmented, with many geographic and cultural barriers. We have designed ShippyPro to cater to the needs of a complex and evolving market by enabling our customers to drive efficiencies across their logistics operations processes, from initial order intake through to tracking and returns,"" said Borghi. ShippyPro currently processes millions of shipments per month for thousands of customers in 36 countries, including well known brands like Diesel, Guess, and Volcom, who rely on the platform and its integrations to ship, track and return their ecommerce orders.""Delivering orders on time is one of the biggest concerns of ecommerce brands. Large and mid-sized B2B and B2C companies still consider shipping one of the biggest pain points to scaling their businesses. The main ecommerce players (e.g. Zalando, Amazon and Alibaba) have invested billions in R&D to make shipping their competitive advantage, resulting in higher customer expectations when it comes to receiving packages,"" said Borghi. ""Our technology provides any brand with a complete shipping solution that optimizes fulfillment, tracking and reverse logistics, enabling our customers to offer the delivery experience consumers expect when they shop online.""ShippyPro's extensive international integration library is a key differentiator in an industry where most competitors focus on integrations with region-specific providers. In just four years, ShippyPro has built integrations with over 140 carriers and 60 sales channels, making the platform a valuable asset for brands that are looking to expand globally.While based in Italy, the management team at ShippyPro has shaped the company with a global focus in mind since its inception. ""Italy has always played a key role in logistics, both within Europe and internationally. We are leveraging the expertise of our team to build advanced features that will optimize ecommerce fulfillment for merchants with a global focus,"" said Borghi. ""We are thrilled to partner with Five Elms to continue to execute on our vision of becoming the leading shipping management software provider globally.""ShippyPro has been growing its team aggressively, expanding from just three employees in 2019 to nearly 50 today. The company plans to continue hiring at a rapid pace, with the goal of reaching 150 employees in 12 months while supporting triple-digit revenue growth. The funding will allow the company to continue to execute on its product roadmap, which includes releasing new features to help customers optimize their fulfillment processes and save budget on logistics spend, including functionality that will focus on the CO2 impact of deliveries.""Despite the growing popularity of online shopping among consumers, many ecommerce merchants still rely on cobbled together point solutions to create, manage, and ship orders. The combination of ShippyPro's ability to automate the entire ordering and shipping process for merchants in one centralized platform and its ability to manage the complexity of shipping across multiple geographies creates a unique value proposition that's incredibly sticky with its customer base,"" said Stephanie Schneider, Partner at Five Elms. ""We are excited to support ShippyPro in its mission to continue delighting its customers all while attracting and retaining best-in-class talent on a global scale.""

To meet the growing demand of Creators using Pietra, the capital injection will be used to grow the internal team, expand the platform and supplier marketplace, and provide creators the most efficient way to create a digital-first commerce brand, from anywhere in the world. Pietra hero imagePietra candle lifestyleThe platform is currently being used as a launchpad for over 20,000 creative entrepreneurs who are using Pietra to create product lines in some of the fastest growing consumer categories like beauty, candles, clothing, skincare, and jewelry. Pietra's ambitious vision is to help power one million creator-owned product lines and brands within the next five years, all of these wholly owned by the Creators. Pietra's Creator Hub makes creating a business much easier for highly creative folks who have a vision but don't know where to begin. Pietra has built an experience that removes the headache from things like sourcing, warehousing, fulfillment and e-commerce, to allow Creators to focus on what really matters: engaging their audience and growing sales. Creators now have the power to develop unique products, with some of the best factories in the world, and start selling online to their audience in a matter of weeks.

Pietra puts the power back into the hands of the Creator by giving them access to a global supply chain while automating the parts of the business that are necessary but not differentiating for a growing DTC brand.Pietra is poised to revolutionize global commerce infrastructure and help usher in a new wave of next-gen, digital-first, brands that are looking to access everything from creative services, production, warehousing, shipping logistics to virtual storefronts that allow people to easily sell online. Accessibility to entrepreneurship has never been easier or more intuitive. ""The Creator Economy has surpassed 50 million income earners worldwide.

(""DBG"") (NASDAQ: DBGI), a curated collection of luxury lifestyle, digital-first brands, today reported financial results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2021. First quarter 2021 Net loss attributable to common stockholders was $3.0 million, or $4.55 per diluted share, on revenue of $408,000. ""Our first quarter 2021 results are a reflection of a combination of factors - limited cash, limited inventory, minimal marketing spend, and the continued effects of COVID-19's impact on Bailey 44,"" said Hil Davis, Chief Executive Officer of Digital Brands Group. ""We expect to see improved operating results in the second quarter and significantly improved operating results in the third and fourth quarters of 2021 now that we have sufficient cash and inventory to support expected levels of operations.""Since our IPO this past May, which bolstered our balance sheet with cash for working capital, we have been able to:ship inventory for DSTLD, which started to arrive at our warehouse in late May, with the majority arriving mid-July to mid-September; ship Bailey 44 product to wholesale accounts starting mid-May, with a significant acceleration in wholesale booking orders for this fall that are in-line with pre-pandemic wholesale levels, and; develop a marketing and advertising plan, including an Amazon marketing strategy, which we are rolling out starting mid-July, with the majority of the spend starting this fall. Additionally, we closed our acquisition of Harper & Jones as part of the IPO. We were not able to include operating of Harper and Jones in our Q1 earnings, as it was not acquired at that point. For the first quarter of 2021, harper and Jones had $903,000 in revenue. Finally, we announced the non-binding LOI to acquire Stateside, which, if the acquisition is consummated, will be accretive to revenue and operating results. The Stateside acquisition and our goal to acquire additional accretive acquisitions, as noted in our S-1, would not have been possible if we had not gone public.Davis concluded, ""This is really the tale of two companies, one pre-IPO with limited cash, inventory and marketing dollars and one post-IPO with a stronger cash position, fully stocked inventory and a meaningful marketing budget and strategy to drive revenue and earnings. Importantly, we expect the second quarter to be better than the first quarter, with the bulk of the post-IPO benefit coming in the third quarter and going forward as the inventory is 100% in stock, the marketing strategy is in full force and Bailey-44 wholesale shipments are back to pre-pandemic levels.""First Quarter 2021 HighlightsNet Sales were $408,000 versus $2.6 million in the year ago quarter. The decline in net sales was driven by COVID-19 delaying the start date of our new Bailey 44 designer until the fall of 2020, and limited inventory at DSTLD due to limited cash. Gross profit declined $1.6 million due to a liquidation of old and obsolescent Bailey 44 and DSTLD inventory at values below the production cost amount. Net loss attributable to common stockholders was $3.0 million, or $4.55 per diluted share, compared to net loss attributable to common stockholders of $1.9 million, or $2.87 per diluted share, in the prior year period.In addition to first quarter results, we wish to make you aware of the following:Second quarter operating results are still expected to be adversely impacted by those factors which impacted the first quarter operating results. However, the adverse impact will be lesser in the second quarter due to the Harper & Jones contribution, Bailey 44 wholesale shipments for May and June, and some inventory levels starting in late May for DSTLD. Second Quarter 2021 UpdatesBailey 44 started shipping wholesale orders in May, which is the first time in fifteen months that Bailey 44 has shipped wholesale orders. Bailey 44 fall 2021 wholesale bookings are in-line with pre-pandemic revenue levels. DSTLD received a men's denim inventory shipment in May, with more men's denim inventory landing in July. DSTLD will receive women's denim inventory shipment in July. DSTLD will receive men's and women's tee shirt inventory shipment in July.

About Digital Brands Group We offer a wide variety of apparel through numerous brands on a both direct-to-consumer and wholesale basis. We have created a business model derived from our founding as a digitally native-first vertical brand. Digital native first brands are brands founded as e-commerce driven businesses, where online sales constitute a meaningful percentage of net sales, although they often subsequently also expand into wholesale or direct retail channels., Unlike typical e-commerce brands, as a digitally native vertical brand we control our own distribution, sourcing products directly from our third-party manufacturers and selling directly to the end consumer. We focus on owning the customer's ""closet share"" by leveraging their data and purchase history to create personalized targeted content and looks for that specific customer cohort. We have strategically expanded into an omnichannel brand offering these styles and content not only on-line but at selected wholesale and retail storefronts. We believe this approach allows us opportunities to successfully drive Lifetime Value (""LTV"") while increasing new customer growth. Digital Brands Group, Inc.

The round was led by M12 - Microsoft's Venture Fund, and included existing investors Boldstart Ventures, Grove Ventures, and Crescendo Ventures. The funds will be used to expand the company's Infrastructure as Code (IaC) platform and accelerate visibility, predictability and governance of cloud deployments as the shift to IaC has been growing dramatically in the last few years.Cloud automation is replacing the manual processes associated with managing and operating cloud-based IT infrastructure to facilitate the delivery of resources. With many organizations around the world relying on the cloud for critical applications and services, we are entering a new era in which the cloud becomes a double-headed entity that includes both code and cloud resources. Automated cloud management translates to significant time savings and operational efficiencies.Over the past 12 months, env0 has seen a surge in customer adoption as enterprises capitalize on the value of IaC automation. The new funding will drive DevOps leaders to use env0's collaborative remote-run workflow management platform for Terraform, Terragrunt and other IaC cloud deployments. The company's IaC automation platform enables users and teams to jointly govern cloud deployments using a range of capabilities that improve deployment provisioning. As a category innovator, env0 has brought several industry-firsts to the domain such as multi-framework support; custom flows; IaC GitOps workflows; cost estimation and actual cost monitoring; Policy as Code using the Open Policy Agent, and more.""After moving our cloud deployments to Terraform, we required an automation layer to streamline both mundane and more advanced IaC automation processes,"" said Amit Daniel, DevOps Team Lead at JFrog.

With lockdowns announced in most of the larger economies and people's reluctance to head out due to fear even after curbs started lifting, the events industry was pushed to adopt a newer alternative that sated the challenges the world faced today. This brought the concept of hybrid events to the mainstream, which was present earlier but has become more prevalent in the middle of the pandemic. A hybrid event is a type of event that combines the ""live"" in-person experience with a ""virtual"" component. Gamescom, Twitchcon, Junction, and Empower 21 are some of the fine hybrid event examples that made big headlines and delivered an even bigger experience to the attendees.""Hybrid meetings are here to stay. Going forward, all major face-to-face events will transition into Hybrid events as they have a higher reach. Hybrid and virtual solutions came into the forefront due to the Coronavirus pandemic when companies did not have any other option to fulfill their meeting objectives,"" said Sneha Das Gupta, Principal Analyst at Beroe Inc. ""Even when the situation normalizes, the hybrid format is expected to rise as the most efficient format of meetings,"" she added. There are many benefits of hybrid events that have propelled its popularity. It includes enhanced reach, attendance, and engagement, plenty of sponsorship opportunities, reduced travel costs, higher flexibility, lower carbon footprint, valuable data, fitting for all kinds of budget, ability to re-watch and share information, and higher returns on investment. But in addition to the benefits, there are also challenges in conducting a hybrid event or meeting; inadequate bandwidth support, finding suitable venues and hotels, and different time zones are some of the common ones. The benefits, however, far outweigh the challenges. 97 percent of event marketers believe there will be more hybrid events in 2021 than ever before. 59.4 percent of them think a hybrid solution will be a significant component of their event strategy this year. More than 50 percent of executives think all live events will possess a virtual dimension in the future. A lot of hybrid event platforms are expected to emerge and dominate. Led by Connected Capital, Brella, a popular hybrid events platform, recently raised $10 million Series A funding. While hybrid events promise greater ROI for businesses, it's essential to have a proper understanding of how to make such unique events a success. Cost management should be robust so to optimize the returns. Major costs in a hybrid event come from virtual event platforms, streaming platforms, filming and virtual event production, venue hire, catering, and internet services. Also, one must know how to effectively increase attendee engagement in hybrid meetings, which can be another big challenge for the organizers. ""The corporate world has quickly realized that there's no binary of whether virtual events are good or in-person events are better. A successful event in the post-COVID era will have the flavors of both,"" said Saranya Sundararajan, Team Lead -- Professional Services and Travel at Beroe Inc. ""And such a model unlocks many new opportunities for businesses to reach more people, drive more engagement, and make a bigger impact. In the coming months, more and more companies and organizers will adopt this model to compliment the societal shift we're going through due to the pandemic.""About Beroe Inc.Beroe is the world's leading provider of procurement intelligence and supplier compliance solutions.

This brings Rasgo's total funding to over $25MMore news about: Rasgo","Rasgo","NEW YORK, June 24, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Rasgo Intelligence, the feature store that is transforming how data scientists engineer, collaborate on, and operationalize Machine Learning (ML) features, announced today a $20M Series A investment round led by Insight Partners, with continued support from Unusual Ventures. This brings Rasgo's total funding to over $25M since its founding. Rasgo was founded by Jared Parker and Patrick Dougherty in 2020 to amplify the impact of data science by enabling end users to explore, clean, join, and transform data into highly curated ML features at 10x velocity. In less than 12 months, Rasgo has accomplished the following:Global enterprise customers across finance, manufacturing, biotech, retail, and alternative energy Released PyRasgo, a free feature engineering experience to give back to the data science community which has already generated over 70,000 downloads Built a world class team across engineering and go-to-market across 3 office locations ""At AES, our mission is to accelerate the future of energy together, improving lives by delivering greener and smarter energy solutions helping everyone on a global scale take part in the evolution of energy. To accomplish this, we are leveraging Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence across our energy businesses, but it is not a simple process."" said Sean Otto, Head of Data Science and Analytics at AES. ""To simplify, accelerate, and scale our AI and ML efforts, we are leveraging Rasgo to create and serve ML features as fast as we can think of them, reducing the time to designing unique and viable solutions from weeks to minutes."" Additionally, in the finance industry, Rasgo is being leveraged to accelerate predictions of financial instrument prices and market volatility. ""Without Rasgo, we would have much difficulty tracking the predictive power of our features to quickly disseminate which trading strategies are delivering alpha,"" said Christian Peressin, Manager at Chisholm Financial Labs, a leading algorithmic hedge fund; ""with Rasgo, we can quickly serve and track features in our ML pipeline, which increases the velocity of our experiment and development loop and enables us to deploy new trading strategies faster.""""In working with thousands of data scientists, we saw first-hand that data science projects continuously fail due to technical limitations and inefficiencies in the feature engineering process,"" said Jared Parker, Rasgo founder and CEO. ""Many ML projects never made it to production, and those that did were plagued with end user frustration due to the sheer time it took to clean, join, and transform data. At Rasgo, we are building a platform that enables data scientists to access and transform data into highly curated ML features in minutes, not weeks. Our early customers have eliminated the feature engineering bottleneck and are now creating more accurate features and models, which have allowed them to finally achieve tangible financial value from ML."" Rasgo is also dedicated to accelerating adoption of the Data Cloud for data science and has developed an integration with Snowflake. ""At Snowflake, we are continuing to build new capabilities for data scientists and data engineers,"" said Snowflake Director of Technology Alliances, Tarik Dwiek. ""Rasgo can help our customers use Snowflake to unlock net new use cases and develop high quality ML features that are ready for production. This can represent significant acceleration of ML projects."" Rasgo will use this funding round to accelerate product development, expand its team with a focus on engineering talent, and build out its go-to-market function. ""For most organizations, data science teams have been largely operating as researchers. Now, they're being asked to operationalize their efforts and deliver quantifiable results to the bottom line,"" said Patrick Dougherty, Rasgo founder and CTO. ""This is a significant transition for data science teams. More often than not, unexpected process and technology limitations are unearthed, preventing teams from successfully making this transition. Rasgo's feature store has already changed that paradigm for our customers, but there are so many more opportunities for us to amplify end user value. We're thrilled to have the capital to hire and grow our world-class engineering team and develop new capabilities to contribute to the data science community."" ""Rasgo stands out as a best-in-class experience for feature engineering, helping data scientists and ML practitioners accelerate a traditionally manual process and transform raw data into actionable insights,"" said George Mathew, Managing Director at Insight Partners.

The funds will enable the company to capitalize on the exploding demand from tech companies building data applications and interactive analytics over big data. Firebolt is a leading player in this highly demanding segment of the market, which is currently underserved. Funding will be used to further expand its product, engineering and go-to-market teams.Since its $37 million Series A in December 2020, Firebolt has gained strong traction with data engineers and software developers seeking to turn their big data into fast interactive experiences for a broad range of applications, spanning from internal BI to customer-facing and operational data applications.Over the past six months, Firebolt has doubled its employee headcount to 100 with plans to double again over the next 12 months.

Nearly one in three Americans are freelancing today, and more than 90 million Americans are expected to freelance by 2028. Companies' demands for freelancers and independent contractors are at an all-time high, but most organizations are not able to equip managers with the required processes and tools to manage non-payroll workers efficiently. Currently, 67% of senior managers in tech companies hire more than 30 freelancers in their department. While 81% expect that number to grow by at least 10% next year, two-thirds are managing their extended workforce using spreadsheets and emails.Most hiring managers are still finding it challenging to source the right talent and struggling to handle the back office overload.Around half of respondents (48%) cite better recruitment methods as an integral first step to enabling better use of freelance talent. A quarter of companies (27%) are looking for simplified finance and legal processes when working with non-payroll workers.

Mitiga's cloud-based solution for cloud and hybrid environments dramatically improves efficiencies for incident readiness and response by aligning around the client's goals. Additionally, instead of the traditional time and materials invoicing, Mitiga clients only pay for its readiness service and receive unlimited Incident Response as part of their subscription. By preparing responses ahead of an attack, Mitiga customers are able to return to operational normalcy in hours instead of days or weeks, as is the case using traditional, services-based incident response techniques. Mitiga's funding was led by ClearSky Security, Atlantic Bridge and DNX. The funding will be used to address the changing mindset for security obsessed enterprise organizations when it comes to incident readiness and response in their ever-growing cloud and hybrid environments.The events of the past year accelerated cloud adoption by allowing organizations to overcome their reluctance to move mission-critical workloads to the cloud. Gartner predicts spending on cloud services to run past $332 billion this year alone, which has also provided a new, lucrative target for hackers; in the first four months of 2020, McAfee reported a 630 percent increase in attacks on cloud services. By 2022, It is predicted that 90 percent of organizations will have a hybrid and multi-cloud environment. This opens up the potential for hackers to move between on-premises data centers and cloud providers, as well as lateral attacks from one cloud provider to another. Aside from the damage attacks to do business, organizations have to endure cyber insurance premium increases, which rose by 29 percent in 2020, according to Fitch Ratings, and some policies have become more difficult to obtain. As the first incident response solution for cloud-based environments, Mitiga has attracted top talent in cyber readiness and response, and armed them with an innovative technology stack to bring speed and transparency to the incident response space. The effect is to bring post-attack return to normalcy down to just hours, vs. days or even weeks with traditional incident response. Post attack responses need to focus on efficiency, and current cloud and hybrid environments have made traditional on-premises approaches to incident readiness and response outdated. ""We have seen firsthand how demoralizing and detrimental slow responses are to cyber attacks,"" said Tal Mozes, co-founder and CEO of Mitiga. ""The cloud represents new challenges for incident readiness and response and we're bringing the industry's first incident response solution in the cloud, for the cloud. This funding will allow us to further our engagements with heads of enterprise security who are looking to recover from an incident in real-time, attract even more of the most innovative cybersecurity minds in the industry, and expand our partner network. I couldn't be more excited about what Mitiga is going to do for cloud-first organizations who understand the importance of cybersecurity readiness and response."" Today's enterprise environments are threatened on an hourly basis with unpredictable incidents. Mitiga's approach to provide unlimited active incident response meets the needs of regulators and business leaders that understand the importance of a resilient incident response solution and allows them to return to business as usual fast. In addition, Mitiga is able to document each event which allows an organization to fix the cause in order to prevent future attacks. ""The increased speed of adoption of cloud platforms has organizations rethinking how they prepare for and react to breaches,"" said Patrick Heim, Partner & CISO at ClearSky. ""Organizations are moving away from mostly reactive incident response processes. Newer approaches focus on preparing companies for inevitable incidents with a focus on tools and services that enable rapidly restoring operations and limiting impact. Mitiga is leading the way in building out this new discipline of cloud focused Incident Readiness and Response. We're excited to be on this journey with them and look forward to transforming the way incidents are managed.""Mitiga's hybrid managed services currently provide Fortune 1000, financial service institutions, banks, ecommerce, law enforcement and government agencies with Incident Response to handle real-time incidents and Incident Readiness that accelerates post-incident bounce back from days down to hours.

The funding will support continued product development as the company expands its operations in the Greater Boston and San Francisco Bay Areas. Founded by a team of energy transition veterans from First Solar and Tesla, Electric Hydrogen is developing large-scale solutions to help ease the world's dependence on fossil fuels. Using low-cost renewable electricity, the company will produce clean hydrogen gas, an ideal medium for the decarbonization of many polluting industrial sectors. ""With their strong track record of success in scaling new clean energy technologies, Electric Hydrogen has what it takes to make good on the promise of hydrogen as a clean and economical building block for decarbonizing industry,"" said Carmichael Roberts, Breakthrough Energy Ventures. ""We're proud to have supported Electric Hydrogen in this vital mission from its inception, and now through its Series A financing."" Hydrogen from renewable electricity is widely seen as a very promising and immediate path to tackling the ""hard to decarb"" sectors of industry like fertilizers, chemicals, steel, and even bulk energy storage and transport. Because of its unique ability to address these and other emerging applications, the global market for clean hydrogen is expected to grow dramatically and could rival the market for natural gas if it can be produced at a compelling price. ""In infrastructure and industry, cost drives decisions,"" said Derek Warnick, CFO. ""That's why we are laser-focused on delivering green hydrogen at a cost that's competitive with fossil fuels. When doing the right thing is actually the lowest cost option, the market will shift very quickly.""By completely re-imagining the design and manufacture of hydrogen electrolysis systems matched to renewable power sources, Electric Hydrogen's mission is to generate truly green hydrogen for a post-carbon world. ""Electrification will play a huge role in reducing carbon emissions, but over a third of emissions come from industrial sectors that are hard to directly electrify,"" said EVP of Engineering Dorian West. ""Low-cost fossil-free hydrogen provides a compelling pathway to decarbonize these dirty industries, which operate at massive scales.""As Electric Hydrogen expands its operations in the Greater Boston and San Francisco Bay Areas, the company is hiring to expand its team and accelerate its efforts. ""Our founding team has dedicated decades to the transformation of the grid and transportation sectors, and now we're bringing that experience to the emerging needs of the industrial sectors,"" said CTO David Eaglesham. ""We're building an amazing team and looking for passionate and creative technical, business and operations rockstars to join us in our mission to leave the world cleaner than we found it, without sacrificing the prosperity of future generations."" ""We see an exciting opportunity to reinvent electrolysis to make green hydrogen at fossil-parity prices within this decade,"" said CEO Raffi Garabedian. ""The keys will be to directly harness very low-cost intermittent renewable energy through radically cost-effective large-scale equipment. We're honored to be backed by visionary climate-tech investors, and together with the engineers and scientists on our team, we're hard at work to enable a clean and abundant future.""
